Green has now been eliminated and combined with the royal blue. This happened around the end of 1880. The rosette at the top, in the proper color was made of wool yarn, the ribbon itself was made of black silk, and the lettering and the tassle of gold. It has a burlap backing on the rosette to which is attached a metal fastener with straight pin to attach to the lothing.

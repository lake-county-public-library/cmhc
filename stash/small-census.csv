To derive the greatest benefit from this index, it is well that you,  the researcher, understand the difficulties encountered in compiling this aid. This knowledge will help you to deal with the complexities of the census.  A. Aptitude for spelling and writing does not now appear to have been prerequisites for early 20th-century census enumerators. In an era  when illiteracy was still an accepted way of life, this is not surprising. What is surprising is the occasionally creative, albeit erroneous, spelling of names.  Writing can appear in tangled, Victorian flourishes; cramped, near= sighted scratches; or lovely, fluid penmanship which has faded to near nothingness. Every style presents its own problems for deciphering the hidden message. Our version, copied as we saw it, may not coincide with your version, as you see it.  Questionable spelling of last names is considered to be one of the most prominent hazards within this work. All names have been recorded as interpreted by the Indexer in regards to careless writing, and as spelled by the enumerator except in those cases when other sources provide a more logical spelling. In these rare instances, the accepted spelling appears in alphabetical order and the name as it appears in the census follows in parenthesis. It is vitally important, therefore, that you search for every possible spelling variation, ""sounds-like,"" foreign and Americanized versions, and even reverse placement of names, i.e. James, Joseph instead of Joseph, James. You may even wish to run through all names within an alphabetical category for the name you desire.  B. Incompleteness in a census is not uncommon. A census can be incomplete in spite of a conscientious census-taker. However, there have been census- takers who took the job only for what they could get out of it or because it was assigned to them by legislative act. Many of these persons were not well qualified and did not satisfactorily fulfill their obligations. Many of the census schedules reflect this because the instructions which the enumerators received (or should have received) were not followed.  Some schedules list persons in a family by initials only. A few schedules list no places of birth or age. Sometimes families were not home when the census-taker made his visit and neighbors were asked to give the information, or if the assistant was personally acquainted with the family he would complete the schedules to the best of his own knowledge. There were also times when young children in the family provided the ""facts"" for the census enumeration if no one else was at home.

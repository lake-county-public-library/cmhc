Two years ago it had no existence, while to-day it has its long streets and broad avenues many miles in extent, with large and handsome build- ings on every side. Recently as August, 1877, only six rude log cabins were to be found, where to-day well designed edifices can be counted by the thousand. The numerous and well stocked business houses, the many elegant and well furnished private residences, the commodious hotels, theaters, churches and schools, together with the broad and well graded streets, give the city a decidedly metropolitan air. Hundreds and thousands of citizens and strangers are constantly passing and repassing through its crowded streets, a fact famiNar to all residents, but a surprise to the new comer, who, upon his artival here; finds himself reminded of Broadway or Canal street. The city owes its existence, as ‘well as its prosperity, to the numerous and rich discoveries ot carbonate veins in the valley of the Upper Arkansas. To the residents of Leadville, who are familiar with the facts which we set forth in this chapter, ujon their young, handsome and progressive city, the observations may seem some- what digressive, but it must be borne in mind that our extensive circulation abroad, where all are desirous of obtaining accurate information of this prolific section, is our excuse for giving data which must not only       ","/img/derivatives/iiif/images/00006cd/full/250,/0/default.jpg","/img/derivatives/iiif/images/00006cd/full/1140,/0/default.jpg",/img/derivatives/iiif/00006cd/manifest.json,directories

Leadville is situated in the valley of the Upper Arkansas, in a natural park or basin near the mouth of California Gulch, in Lake county, Colorado. It presents one of the most picturesque sites which can be viewed anywhere in our youthful and prosperous State. The grand old mountains surround it on every side, whose numerous snow clad peaks tower majes- tically up in the far off distance, lending beauty and enchantment to the scene. The early history of this section is not devoid of interest. Following the Pike’s Peak excitement of 1859 in the subsequent year, rich placer diggings were discovered in California Guich which brought to this locality thousands of adven- turous miners. For a few years this was one of the most prosperous mining canips in the west, yielding millions of treasure. As soon as these placers had been worked out the guich becanre almost deserted, remaining so until 1874, when carbonate ores were dis- covered and their true quality determined. It was not, however, until about two years ago that the furore broke out regarding the camp, which gives strong promise of being the richest silver producing section inthe world. Already millions have been extracted from the mines, and the yield of the present year is estimated at twelve million dollars. Ample smelting and sampling works are dotted around on every side, running dey and night, transforming the ore into bullion. Fully a dozen of these establishments are in operation, and others are fast being completed to meet the rapid increase in tHe production of ore.  There are at least a hundred paying mines con- tributing to the wealth of the country, while the rich Prospects are almost innumerable. The camp has been frequently the “poor man’s camp” on account of           ","/img/derivatives/iiif/images/00007cd/full/250,/0/default.jpg","/img/derivatives/iiif/images/00007cd/full/1140,/0/default.jpg",/img/derivatives/iiif/00007cd/manifest.json,directories

Prospectors continue to delve on every hill-side’ with success, and for many years to come extensive rewards remain in store for those who have willing hands and strong arms to aid in the develop- ment of the country. To give an idea of the extent that mining has assumed, it may be stated that one local company is operating upon a capital of twenty million dollars, and its properties promise to yield largely upon the investment. Other and numerous corporations and private individuals are doing propor- tionately as well with claims which have been but a short time under development.  The health of a country frequently elicits consid- erable inquiry. In this connection it can be stated that the city has an altitude of 10,200 feet above sea level, which occasions some new comers slight diffi- culty in respiration, but this is soon overcome by a brief residence. - No contagious or infectious diseases exist, and the greater number of deaths thus far have been from pneumonia; this, however, must not be attributed so much to climate and local causes as to the careless manner in which many persons have lived. The pioneers had but little shelter other than their blankets, and many of them not-being used to the rigors of a_ mining camp, succumbed to the fell destroyer. This: has now all changed. Large and well furnished hotels, the accommodations of which are second to none in the State, are numerous, while cottages and cabins, contiguous to the business portion of the city, can readily be purchased or rented by those who come into our midst, A full supply of pure crystal water is distributed to the dwellings and                                                                                                       ","/img/derivatives/iiif/images/00008cd/full/250,/0/default.jpg","/img/derivatives/iiif/images/00008cd/full/1140,/0/default.jpg",/img/derivatives/iiif/00008cd/manifest.json,directories

Good sani- | tary regulations prevail under the supervision ot a vigilant and well informed police. A regular city government exists, having a board of Councilmen, at | the head of which is a Mayor, under whose direction | all municipal matters are controlled. In point of law | and order the city compares favorably with any of similar size in the Union, despite some reports having | been circulated abroad to the contrary. .

Building continues with unabated vigor, banks, hotels, stores, residences, churches and manu- facturing establishments are springing up as though erected by the hand of magic. Businesses of all kinds are increasing daily. Aside from the purely ; local trade of the place, an extensive and lucra- | tive business is being done with the many rich and | prosperous mining camps within a circuit of twenty | miles. : At present the city is reached by one day’s travel, partly by rail, and partly by coach, from Denver, Canon | City, Colorado Springs, or Georgetown. Three lines | of railway are rapidly pushing for this rich goal, and ere a few months shall have elapsed, the shrill whistle of locomotives will wake the hitherto silent echoes of the Upper Arkansas. Everything in the way of busi- ness has been established upon a solid, though exten- 1 sive basis. The merchants and the miners alike evince a meritorious enterprise, which is fast developing the country and giving it that importance to which it is so justly entitled. Already a Mining and Stock Exchange is in successful operation, while three well conducted       ","/img/derivatives/iiif/images/00009cd/full/250,/0/default.jpg","/img/derivatives/iiif/images/00009cd/full/1140,/0/default.jpg",/img/derivatives/iiif/00009cd/manifest.json,directories

Without proceeding into the statistical details of individual enterprises, which is hardly within the scope of such a work as this, the reader can form a pretty accurate idea of the extent and character of the business carried on in Leadville, by scrutinizing the list of names with their occupations, which at great labor, and with much care. we have prepared and set forth in this work.  The field in and around Leadville for judicious investment is still quite extensive, and opportunities are frequently presenting themselves to be taken advan- tage of by the sagacious and energetic capitalist.

  from the 600 block of Harrison Avenue in Leadville, Colorado, showing two and three
  story brick and wood frame clapboard buildings with pedestrians walking on concrete
  pavement. Buildings that can be seen include the old Lake County Court House with
  Lady Justice and her scales and the American National Bank with its corner tower
  dome. The cafe on the west side located between West 6th and West 7th Street is
  probably the Saddle Rock Cafe which opened in 1916 at 607 Harrison Avenue. The owner
  was Alfred Gross. The cafe closed or was moved from there in 1938. Business signs

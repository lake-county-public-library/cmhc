# Colorado Mountain History Collection

This special, non-circulating collection is housed in our beautiful Leadville Room and contains over 4000 items of various media relating to the history of Leadville and the surrounding areas. The collection is available for Lake County genealogical research. The digital and physical collections are always growing, see the CMHC Digitization and Collection Development Plan for more information.

Researchers are welcome to utilize the collection during business hours. Library staff can assist you with your searches, show you where our sources are located, and help you get started.

For those unable to come to Leadville, our local history staff can perform limited searches for you. Due to the volume of requests we receive, please allow at least 12-14 business days for a response to your request. Requests are processed in the order in which they are received. Please include as much information in your request as possible that will assist in expediting the search, including resources/records already searched/found.  
 
Research is performed within the resources we hold; we do not perform research at other sites, including churches, other libraries, etc. We also cannot handle extensive requests, i.e. researching an entire family line, or tracing the entire history of a building or house. Researchers are on site Mon-Fri 10-5. If you need a weekend appointment please email to check availability.

text: 'WILL/PROBATE INDEX INTRODUCTION  This compilation is an alphabetical recording
  of will/probate proceedings administered in Lake County, Colorado, between March
  of 1879 (the Courts'' earliest.such records) through October of 1988.  This includes
  "foreign" Wills.  Recordkeeping systems have changed during the 100+ years encompassed
  in this work, which could prove to be confusing to those who are unfamiliar with
  those changes. In the beginning, handwritten entries were made into ledgers which
  were titled to designate the record kept therein and which were also imprinted with
  a letter, such as "A", to differentiate between ledgers within a set. By the late
  1940s-early ''50s, individual cases were being given a consecutive docket number
  and, later, all materials pertaining to one case were placed into a separate file
  folder. And lastly, a new numbering system was introduced in 1979. Instead of progressing
  to ever- higher numbers (such as 9841, 9842, etc.), cases are now given a number
  which begins with the year, plus "PR" for Probate Record, and the consecutive number
  within that year. Example: 85PR52.  Whenever possible, we have given a year directly
  below the name, to aid in identification. This date may reflect the year of death,
  the year of filing, or simply an era (indicated by "c.") in which proceedings took
  place. Minor heirs and wards are indicated with an "M" or "W" following their name.  It
  is possible that more than one person with the same first and last name, but no
  distinguishing middle name, initial, or date, have been listed as one. On the other
  hand, some ledger entries include a middle name or initial for someone who had previously
  been recorded without that identification and, therefore, one person may appear
  under more than One listing.  As in most undertakings of this type, you may possibly
  find errors. The numerous causes of such errors (such as misspelled names, illegible
  handwriting, and the monotony of typing endless numbers) are well known to everyone
  who has dealt with old records and will not be further enumerated here. Let it suffice
  to say that we have done our best to eliminate mistakes, because they are as distressing
  to us as they are to you, but we cannot vouch for accuracy. Be sure to check all
  possible entries, including all possible spelling variations.  Our thanks to Myrna
  Salberg, Clerk of the Combined Courts, for her generous cooperation. And our thanks
  to Gene Frodsham for his interest and monetary support for this project, which was
  pleasantly unexpected!  For information concerning copies of original documents,
  contact Clerk of the Combined Courts, Lake County Courthouse, Leadville, Colorado.  This
  project is dedicated to Leadville''s history, which brought together the two members
  of the Historical Research Cooperative, enriched their lives and rewarded them with
  a forever friendship. '

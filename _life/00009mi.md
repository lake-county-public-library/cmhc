text: 'INTRODUCTION  As with all of our indices, we need to make you, the user, aware
  of a few facts which may aid you in doing research in this book.  First, this is
  NOT a complete record of all of the people who were married in Lake County, Colorado
  ~ for two reasons. Marriage licenses were required in Colorado beginning in May
  of 1881, and marriages were recorded in the county where the license was issued.
  Lake County has recorded marriages which took place all over the state of Colorado,
  as Â© well as several from out-of-state. It is probably safe to assume that many
  people who were married in Lake County obtained their license else- where and, therefore,
  are not recorded here.  The second reason for this being an incomplete record is
  the fact that prior to May of 1881, it was left up to the parties involved to have
  their marriage recorded. Many didn''t bother to do this.  Marriages are recorded
  in Books 1, 2, B, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15. Beginning with Book 14,
  page 181, marriage records are filmed on aperture cards. After Book 15, page 590,
  marriage records are filmed with real estate records. Filmed records are given a
  three-digit number, such as 486, in this index.  Once again, we must stress that
  this index is riddled with errors. Innumerable names were misspelled in the records
  - oftentimes spelled phonetically and as often just spelled catch-as-catch-can.
  Much as we would like to correct the obvious mistakes for the sake of accuracy in
  this index, we do not have the right to do so.  And then, of course, there are our
  errors. IJllegible handwriting gives us fits, too! We read it the best that we can,
  give it our interpret- ation, and hope for the best. All other errors found within
  were caused by gremlins!  We ask that you search for every possible spelling (and
  "misspelling" ) variation, no matter how far-fetched, and we wish you luck with
  your search!  Copies of original materials can be obtained, for a nominal fee, by
  contacting the County Clerk and Recorder''s Office, Lake County Courthouse, Leadville,
  Colorado 80461.  This project is dedicated to our husbands, Joe Manly and Bob Warford.  1990  Compiled
  by: Nancy Manly, Leadville, Colorado. Typed by: Sherrill Warford, Mountain Home,

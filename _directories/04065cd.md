  the richer and sweeter plums have been collected into one portion. In the already
  well-developed portions of Leadville which lie immediately west of the Gold Belt,
  the ore bodies have been found in continuous parallel chutes or channels in the
  limestone, and are gener- ally separated, one from another, by rolls of barren rock
  and intervening por- phyry dikes. These ore chutes, occurring on different horizons
  and contact planes in the sedimentary formations, have a most remarkable northeasterly
  course. They have been developed continuously, in many instances for three- quarters
  of a mile, and are not interrupted in any instance by either a change of horizon
  or by dislocation in faulting. As shown by the arrows upon the map, the easterly
  continuation of many of these chutes will lead directly into the terri- tory of
  Breece hill and the Leadville Gold Belt. The extended lines of the Iron hill, Rock
  hill and Printer Boy hill chutes, all lead directly into this district, and the
  gold-producing mines now being operated by the Ibex Mining company, the Golden Eagle
  company, the Little Ellen, Midnight, and others, are in the pro- longation of the
  Iron hill ore chutes.  It is, therefore, a reasonable assumption that the rich gold-bearing
  ores now opened on this Gold Belt are in the continuation of the same ore bodies
  previously disclosed further west, and are a part of this system, which ore chutes
  have been enriched in their gold contents by the influence of the porphyry dikes,
  as already referred to. If this be true, it is an assurance of wealth and prosperity
  for the Leadville District, which no other mining locality can claim, and which,
  in the unequaled advantages of the general formation for mining operations, will
  be everywhere accessible and practically inexhaustible.  The ores of the Leadville
  Gold Belt are found at the contact plane of the blue limestone with the eruptive
  rocks and in the lower horizons of the limestone, and also in the porphyry dikes.  The
  developments so far have not extended below the limits of oxidation, and the ore
  has been mostly of a silicious character, stained with the oxides of iron, and,
  in many cases, carrying silver and lead in considerable quantities. The greatest
  depth attained does not exceed six hundred feet, though it is probable that, upon
  deeper developments, the more refractory ores will be encountered in large quantities,
  and gold-bearing sulphides of lead, iron, zinc and copper will be found.  A great
  deal of the gold contained in the ores of the Gold Belt is in a free state, notably
  that which is found in the porphyry, as is the case with the mill- ing ores of the
  Antioch mine, but in the great majority of cases the gold is contained in a highly
  silicious ore carrying silver, and heavily stained with the oxides of iron. Such
  ores cannot be treated by stamps and amalgamation to the best advantage, and experiments
  of this kind have resulted in a considerable loss of the gold values. The silver
  values are a secondary feature, as about 80 per cent. of the net value of the ore
  is in gold. At the present time those ores are treated by smelting, and the lower
  grade ores, which contain under $12 in gold and a few ounces in silver, cannot stand
  the treatment charge on such silicious ores, and consequently are entirely neglected.
  Numerous bodies of this class of ore now exist and will be continually opened nearer
  the surface, but from a long experience, and careful study of this region, | have
  no fear in venturing the opinion that the largest and most permanent ore bodies
  of Breece hill and the Gold Belt will eventually be disclosed in lower horizons
  in the limestones and quartzites, which have not yet been reached, and in large
  bodies of gold-bearing pyrite, which a century will not exhaust. '

text: "    AN IMMENSE MOTHER VEIN. 19     A certain professor, eminent as a metallurgist,
  who has, it is said, a wide experience in mineral formations, advised ‘‘to have
  nothing to do with the mines of the noble metals that occur in a granite formation;
  that they were not, and could not be, persistent—go down—in depth!”’ This is certainly
  rough on the Anaconda and Granite mines of Montana, at the north, and the Congress
  gold mine of Arizona, to the south, the latter with a record of $1c,000,c00 product.
  It was sold, some time ago, for $1,250,000. Others could be cited ad tnfinitum,
  as examples, where the inclosing walls and country formation are granite.  Again,
  you will hear limber-jawed experts say that a permanent gold ledge did not exist
  unless at least one of the walls was of slate, nor could it be found. Now, this
  information is quite refreshing. If a man would confine such asser- tions to his
  personal experience, and stop there, it would be all right. A slate wall is a very
  desirable condition in a gold mine. None could be better; but if only those mines
  in slate, or slate contact, were producers of the yellow metal, the bimetallic problem
  would soon be solved, for there would not be nearly enough gold produced for the
  arts. The moneyed novice in mining affairs is generally a good single-handed listener,
  and such wild assertions as given might result in harm, and some of our volunteer
  experts may profit by this kindly hint.  Given a competent knowledge of terrestial
  magnetism, in its bearings on minerals, the formations and fillings of veins, and,
  in short, the whole phenom- ena of geology in its relation to mining, it is impossible
  to form a correct opinion of any new and unexplored ground, and a reflective man
  will not advance an opinion on a territory or formation of which he knows nothing.
  Experience has shown that, for permanent mining, the older the rocks are the better
  the pros- pects for deep and lasting works. Porphyry is an essential constituent,
  either as a wail-rock or forming a dike in connection with most, if not all, large
  bullion- producing mines. The great Comstock of Nevada was encased in a green- stone
  porphyry, called prophylite, and it has been observed that when this por- phyry
  runs out or ceases to exist the mineral becomes low grade. Forty per cent. of the
  value of these ores was gold. At Nagybanya, in the mines of Tran- sylvania, where
  large amounts of native gold and silver are produced, the rock is all porphyry.
  The richest mines in southern Siberia are in syenite and por- phyry. The gold-bearing
  conglomerate reefs of Johannesburg, South Africa, are in quartzite. Limestone and
  quartzite contact walls, in a porphyry country rock, inclose the Harqua Hala mine
  of Arizona.  Hence, experience has taught us that we are in the right locality,
  and that - Breece hill, Ball mountain, and the country north and south for miles,
  all within the lines of Lake county, contain the very best conditions. We have the
  lime- stone and porphyry, with the quartz and quartzite as close neighbors.  It
  is a well-known fact to all practical prospectors and miners, that the con- ditions
  under which gold exists in the different districts in Colorado differ so widely
  that it is absolutely necessary for a person to have some experience in several
  different districts in order to become proficient in the calling. The change in
  the formation and in other features is so great, sometimes within the distance of
  a mile, that a miner or prospector who may be competent and successful in one district
  would find that his knowledge obtained in that locality would avail him but little
  in the other. Even in different districts situated any great distance apart, where
  the same formation and geological conditions exist in both, the con- ditions under
  which the gold is found in paying quantities are so different that it awakens the
  miner and prospector to the fact that he must make a special study of each locality
  where he prospects; for a rule that may hold good in two "

text: "   KOKOMO, 19     promptitude is not only a virtue but a necessity, the deed
  is accomplished while his eastern brother is yet engaged in weighing the chances
  and ‘estimating the worth of arguments pro andcon. Guided by western : hands and
  impelled by western enterprise, the Star of {| Kokomo mounted rapidly toward the
  zenith. - ' Life ina new town in the dead of winter must \\ i  { | cide, and especially
  prompt to act, in a land, where t ‘ {  necessarily imply no mean degree of hardship.
  The settlers of Kokomo were not exempt from the general rule. Coarse fare and a
  blanket laid upon the snow- : drift, with no cevering save the starry heavens, or
  later on, an unchinked and ungabled cabin, with roof of earth piled loosely upon
  pine boughs, served the needs alike of the toil hardened miner and the child of
  lux- ury. For some time lumber was unattainable, and all buildings were of rough
  or hewn logs. Soon; how- ever, saw mills, attracted by the increasing prosperity
  of the camp, began to come in, and the shriek of the steam whistle echoed amid rocky
  fastnesses where late was heard only the cry of the mountain lion or the hooting
  of the owl.  Now, as if by the wand of magic art, stately buildings have arose,
  and, at the present time, the eye of the stranger glancing down the principal street,
  rests in pleased surprise upon the graceful proportions of buildings which would
  do credit to many an east- er city of ancient date.  Notwithstanding the drawbacks
  presented by sev- era] feet of snow, many rich mines have already been discovered
  and opened. Upon Sheep Mountain the “Wheel of Fortune,” “The Smuggler,” “ Undine,”
  \ * “Big Giant,” and “Silver Tip;” upon Elk Mountain, | “The Climax,” “ Aftermath,”
  and ‘“‘ White Quail,” and upon Jack Mountain, the “ Rising Sun” and “ Addey ”       "

text: 'Exploitation of a Theory.  PRACTICAL DEMONSTRATION OF THE VIEWS OF MINING MEN
  OF NATIONAL RENOWN.  By JOHN F. CAMPION, Manager of the Ibex, Stag, Wapiti, Yak
  and other Mining Companies.  ee exploration work started, some three years ago,
  on the property of the  Ibex Mining Company, situate on Breece hill, within the
  lines of the territory now popularly called the Gold Belt, was conceived on the
  theory that the ore chutes of Carbonate and Iron hills were probably more or less
  continuous through Breece hill, and that at one time, before the glacial and faulting
  periods, they were likely connected with the ore chutes of Little Ellen hill; that
  is, the latter ore bodies were part and parcel of the same system of ore clutes
  already discov- ered and explored in the hills first named.  The prospecting and
  exploration work done by our company since 1891 seems to strongly confirm the correctness
  of the assumption on which the enterprise was projected. It will, however, take
  some considerable time and quite an ex- penditure of money yet, before the absolute
  certainty of the theory shall be demonstrated.  The present known limits of the
  Leadville Gold Belt seem to be about four square miles, lying between Big Evans
  gulch on the north and lowa gulch on the south. The geological conditions presented
  in this part of the Leadville Dis- trict do not seem to differ materially from the
  known geology of Fryer, Carbonate and Iron hills, except that on Breece hill the
  overlying porphyry is considerably thicker, and that gray porphyry dikes and intrusive
  sheets of the same material seem to occur with more frequency than on the adjacent
  mineral - bearing hills to the west and southwest.  The ore horizon, so far as we
  have been able to determine, occurs mainly upon a bed or layer of intrusive porphyry,
  varying in thickness from five to seventy feet; next below the porphyry occurs the
  so-called contact, averaging probably twenty-five feet in thickness, and below the
  latter the blue limestone. We have, however, found one ore body lying between the
  porphyry and limestone, just as ore is found on Carbonate and Iron hills. We have
  also found some ore within limestone walls, and at present we have a very good prospect
  of finding another body of ore within the limestone.  For these reasons, it would
  seem that there are three places in the Breece hill formation where ore can be intelligently
  sought for, viz.: above the intrusive porphyry which overlies the contact, in the
  contact proper, between the porphyry and limestone, and in the mass of the blue
  limestone next to the contact.  It is probably a reasonable approximation to say
  that the average thickness of the porphyry of the Gold Belt district is five hundred
  feet.  In addition to this factor, the problem of water will cut an important figure. '

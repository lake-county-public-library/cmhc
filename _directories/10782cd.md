text: 'INTRODUCTION.  This is the thirty-fourth edition of the Leadville City Direc-
  tory. It has had the advantage of a corps of carefully trained, experienced directory
  men who have been doing the same work | for many years, so that the work may be
  relied upon ag being | complete and accurate in every respéct.  The Directory is
  a semi-public utility absolutely necessary to modern business, social, political.
  and religious progress.  The City Directory not only shows each of Leadville resi-
  dents just what their city is, but spreads the same information ‘. broadeast over
  the whole United States. Copies of this Directory : are placed in the Directory
  Libraries in all the principal cities of . the country, where they are readily available
  for reference. use by the public. There they serve as a perpetual advertisement
  of Leadville, for business men the country over realize that the City Directory
  represents the community as it really is.  I wish to thank the publie for their
  co-operation in making . this work possible. ae  Respectfully, WIL H. RICHARDS.

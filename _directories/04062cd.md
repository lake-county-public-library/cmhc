text: 'The Ophir of Colorado.  BEGINNING OF THE THIRD OR GOLDEN ERA OF LEADVILLE’S
  WONDERFUL MINING HISTORY.  By A. A. BLOW, M. E., Member of the American Institute
  of Mining Engineers.  HERE is but one Leadville! The wealth and prosperity of this,
  the greatest  mining State in the Union, can be more justly attributed to the mineral
  pro- duction derived from a few square miles of rocky, broken ground, lying in the
  very backbone of the American continent, near the headwaters of the Arkansas river,
  and overtopped by lofty snow-clad peaks of solemn grandeur and sublim- ity, than
  to the combined product of the remainder of Colorado’s now famous and varied resources.
  This little area, insignificant in comparison with the broad and fertile acres of
  plains and foothills of Colorado, and valueless for the super- ficial uses of man,
  except in an abundance of fresh air, scenery and climate, embraces the Leadville
  Mining District, and holds beneath its rugged surface a natural treasure-vault,
  which centuries of time will not exhaust and national legislation can never destroy.  The
  history of this district has been often written, and is familiar to the world, both
  in its reality and romance; but the true conception of its vast reserves of silver,
  gold, lead, copper, zinc and iron has rarely been justly portrayed, and never exaggerated.  Since
  the discovery of the wonderful carbonate ores of Leadville, in 1878 and 1879, this
  district has been without a rival, the most important and the largest producer of
  smelting ores in the West. For the past fifteen years the net value of Leadville’s
  product has exceeded that of any other mining district of Colo- rado, while the
  actual tonnage extracted from its mines has, year by year, been greater than that
  of all the rest of the State combined. As a ‘‘ Carbonate Camp,” and producer of
  the famous smelting ores of lead and silver; as a ship- per of the more refractory
  roasting sulphides of lead, zinc and iron; and as the great supply depot of argentiferous
  iron fluxing ores, Leadville has held and still holds undisputed supremacy.  But
  a few months ago the mining industry of Leadville was disastrously crippled, and
  her prestige apparently lost. By the sudden fall in the price of silver and lead,
  which occurred in July last, Leadville received a check which even the most sanguine
  could not help admitting was a case of partial paralysis, with a serious prospect
  of a total annihilation of her only industry.  Silver was then supposed to be her
  only hope and salvation, and the death- blow received by the white metal was thought
  by many to be the signal for her rapid decay and abandonment. That period of depression,
  however, has only served to turn a new page in Leadville’s history, and to usher
  in the third or Golden Era of this wonderful mining district, which is destined
  to be the most  ee '

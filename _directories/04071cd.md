text: '12 THE LEADVILLE GOLD BELT.     It is true that, up to date, the most valuable
  ore has been extracted from the contact, or from points very near the contact, at
  the top of the blue limestone, and it is probable that at this horizon, and below
  it, will be found the main bodies of ore; but a number of veins known to exist above
  this horizon in the sedi- ene and eruptive rocks both make it possible on Breece
  hill that a shaft sunk at random may strike ore at any horizon.  The bodies of eruptive
  rock to the west, and overlying the silver bonanzas, were never known to contain
  a single streak or layer of pay ore. The Gold Belt, therefore, other things being
  equal, presents better chances for great discoveries than does the Silver Belt.  The
  principal mines, so far, have done little more than follow the ore in sight; and
  but little real prospecting for other bodies has been done in any of them. The extraordinary
  mineralization of the rocks at the outcrop and in the work- ings of the Little Johnnie,
  Uncle Sam, Eliza and Highland Chief points to the existence of ore bodies above
  and below the horizon which have been exclusively followed so far, and a systematic
  prospecting will probably be rewarded by new discoveries. The Antioch mine, which
  consists of a gold-bearing body of por- phyry, between walls of similar eruptive
  rock, has been followed in depth quite extensively, but prospecting by diamond drill
  for other and similar veins in the vicinity has never been done, to the writer’s
  knowledge. The tunnels on this property certainly cross-cut the country to some
  extent, but a diamond drill, operated horizontally and vertically from these tunnels,
  could do an immense amount of valuable prospecting.  The Florence, on Printer Boy
  hill, has taken out large amounts of gold- bearing ore from the limestone, and the
  porphyry overlying it, but the extension of these bodies to the north has never
  been developed.  Outside of these mines there are hundreds of prospect holes, varying
  in depth from ten to three hundred feet, in this belt. A number of them have found
  small streaks of ore, but none have work enough to determine anything. Further and
  heavier development is essential. In fact, the Gold Belt is in its infancy, giving
  promise of better and greater things even than were disclosed in the Silver Belt,
  if work is prosecuted as vigorously on the first as it was on the latter, and the
  present developments in the Ibex and the Golden Eagle certainly warrant such work.
  All ore bodies discovered so far were found in the oxidized state. At greater depth
  the original sulphides will be found. If these have valus, like those in the Silver
  Belt, the working of a very extensive area is assured.  Referring to the wonderful
  metamorphosis of Leadville from a silver to a gold producer, within the brief period
  of a half year, a recognized mining authority, in a publication of January tst,
  1894, says: ‘‘ Leadville is again at the front. The great carbonate camp, reported
  as ‘“‘played out’’ when Congress repealed the silver purchasing law, may now apply
  for a change of name. It is no longer Leadville; the proper designation is Gold-ville,
  it having changed, since the June slump in the price of the white metal, from the
  great silver camp of the world to the leading gold producer of this State, an example
  of such rapid and noiseless development that the net result in ounces of gold seems
  incredible. But the figures are so conservative, and so fully supported by daily
  shipments of ore, that successful contradiction may safely be challenged from sources
  in or out of the State.” '

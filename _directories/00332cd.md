text: 'wil  INTRODUCTORY.  Orrick oF THE CITY Preserowset  Junx, 1882.  This our third
  annual volume of the Leadville City Directory we believe will be found even more
  useful than its predecessors, in consequence of the more settled and permanent condition
  of our citizens. The information haa been collected in the most careful manner by
  thoroughly competent persons, and we have spared neither labor or expense to make
  it accurate and usefal to the public, as well as creditable to the city.  We feel
  that we have reason to congratulate our citizens upon the continued prosperity in
  our business circles, as well as the permanency of our great mining interests, which
  were never in & more flourishing and prosperous condition than at present: Building
  has assumed a more substantial character, and during the present year many new buildings
  will be erected that will be both serviceable and ornamental.  Hoping this volume
  will meet the approbation of the public generally, and prove to our business men
  that it is worthy of a more general and substantial patronage, we take this opportunity
  to express our sincere thanks to those who have extended their favors to sustain
  us in the publication of a work so convenient and indispensable. Cc. & B. '

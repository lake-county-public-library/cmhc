text: 'INTRODUCTORY.  OFFICE OF THE CITY DIRECTORY, August, 1904. }  In introducing
  the twenty-third annual volume of the Leadville City Directory, the publishers wish
  to call attention to the fact that the same regularity, promptness and accuracy
  which has characterized this work during its career of greatest usefulness, mark
  its advent in 1904, for it is presented to its patrons and the public at regular
  appointed time, the same time of the year as its predecessors. The issue of the
  City Directory is of considerable importance to the community, for it is not merely
  a catalogue of names and addresses; it is the cityâ€™s annual statement of progress.  The
  publishers desire to extend their thanks for all courtesies shown their representatives
  while engaged in gathering information for this work. They also call attention to
  the progressive citizens and business men whose advertisements and patronage was
  extended to make a work of this kind possible, every one of whom is worthy of the
  most implicit confidence.  THE PUBLISHERS. '

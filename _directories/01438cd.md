text: "   INTRODUCTORY.  OrFicr or THE Ciry DirEcrory, August, 1890.  With the issue
  of the eleventh annual volume of the Leadville City Directory we are pleased to
  note the marked im- provement in all branches of trade, which is probably due to
  the renewed activity in our great mining interests, owing to the increased value
  of our chief products—silver and lead—it having stimulated work upon properties
  that have never been opened up, and have heretofore been comparatively unknown,
  as well as the working of mines that have heretofore proved unprofitable.  We now
  feel that a new era of activity in our great industry has already begun, which will
  draw capital and trade to our midst, and an increase to the population of our young
  and enterprising city. Indeed, we are gratified to state to our citizens that the
  present volume contains an increase of 522 names over its predecessor, and to show
  that our statement is founded upon facts we give the number of names in the edition
  of last year as well as those contained in this issue. The work for 1889 contained
  6,680, while the present volume has 7,202 names.  We, therefore, feel that we have
  just cause for congratula- tion, and take this opportunity to return our sincere
  thanks to the citizens of Leadville for the many favors and courtesies annually
  extended to us during the compilation of this publication. .  THE PUBLISHERS.    "

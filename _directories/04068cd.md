text: 'EXPLOITATION OF A THEORY. 9        For these reasons, it is not reasonable
  to expect much from any of the new enter- prises now started, in the way of adding
  to our output, within a year. The same conditions will apply equally as well to
  those shafts which will be started as soon as the heavy snows of winter disappear,
  so that locomotion may be possible. Meanwhile, the shafts that have already reached
  contact will go on with a steady production of the yellow metal, of which the citizens
  of the Cloud City need not be ashamed. :  The writer’s faith in the future of Breece
  hill is not of recent birth, as the columns of The Herald Democrat will bear witness.
  Breece hill is greater in area than that of Carbonate, Fryer and Iron hills combined.
  Wherever shafts have been sunk, and intelligent prospecting done, good ore has been
  disclosed in every instance. The average value of the ore is fully as high as was
  the average of Carbonate, Fryer and Iron hills in their palmy days. The latter hills
  have already produced about one hundred and seventy-five millions of dollars.  Taking
  all of the facts and surroundings into consideration, it would seem to be a fair
  assumption that Breece and Printer Boy hills will be equally as large producers
  of gold, when they are as extensively explored, as the former world- famous producers
  -- Carbonate, Fryer and Iron hills — have been and now are of silver and lead.  To
  sum up, I conclude as follows:  That the Leadville District is the most productive
  and extensive mining region yet discovered in the United States, and probably in
  the world,  That the Carbonate Camp''s production of gold for the year 1894 will
  be the second largest—if it is not the first—of any mining district in the State.  That
  during the year 1895 we may confidently expect to exceed the gold production of
  any other mining locality in Colorado.  And, finally, that in 1896 we are very likely
  to PRODUCE MORE GOLD IN THIS LOCALITY THAN ALL OF THE BALANCE OF THE STATE COMBINED,
  unless some new districts of more extent and value shall be discovered in the interval.     In
  a communication to a Colorado newspaper, published on the first of Janu- ary, 1894,
  Professor A. A. Blow, M. E., estimated the production of gold ores in the Leadville
  District at 510 tons per day, yielding 502 ounces gold, and closed with the following
  summary of performance of the few gold properties then being operated: ‘‘ This shows
  a daily output equal in volume to $10,040. For thirty days this figures $301,200,
  and for twelve months $3,614,400, the highest gold output thus far claimed for any
  camp in the State. In this calculation, the huge ore producers of Carbonate hill,
  Fryer hill, Yankee hill and Sugar Loaf mountain, shipping an aggregate of 250 tons
  per day, all of which carries more or less gold, have not been included. They are
  thrown in as ballast. A conservative esti- mate would give them credit for twenty
  ounces per day, and this adds $12,000 per month to the gold product of the camp,
  or $t44,000 per year, making the grand total—based on present development only—equal
  $3,758,400.”’    '

text: "            10 CARBONATEVILLE,  names of some of the min√©s which are coming
  promi- nently before the public: Wheel of Fortune, Undine, Smuggler, Grand Union,
  Tip Top, Star of the West, Highland Mary, Big Giant, Idalia, Silver Tip, Ballarat,
  Oriental, Rattler, Mountain Stake, Golden Cord, A. C. Holtz, Fletcher, Wagoner,
  1876, Bartlett, Bullion, Normal, Hunter, One Third Per Cent., Manitou, Black Warrior,
  Wisconsin, Chelsey Berch, Argenta, Little Gem, Orphan Boy and Thanksgiving. The
  first named has a developed body of mineral nineteen feet, the width of which has
  not yet been determined. The Undine and Smuggler mines have a body of mineral eight
  feet in thickness and of immense richness. The Grand Union has a showing of 75 feet
  of mineral. These mines all furnish a good grade of ore, and are yielding most handsomely
  to their owners notwith- standing they are compelled to make their shipments of
  ore upon pack animals to Leadville. The mines mentioned are all located in close
  proximity to Car- bonateville, upon Sheep, Chalk, Fletcher, Bartlett, Round and
  Rough mountains. They all have been developed sufficiently to produce ore for smelting
  pur- poses, and as soon as a smelter is established large yields of rich bullion
  will ensue. Within the city limits some rich mineral indications have been found
  to crop out, and all around it vast bodies of mineral wealth lie buried, inviting
  enterprise, capital and labor to come forward for their speedy development. Both
  silver and gold exist in large paying quantities, while of the baser metals there
  isa profusion. Everything conducive to the speedy development of Carbonateville
  and its surroundings seem to exist and invite co-opera- tion. The locality is one
  in which persons can invest their means and toil to advantage, while the climate
  and scenery each seem to contribute largely toward mak- ing life pleasant.          "

text: 'INTRODUCTORY.  OFFIcE oF THE City DirEcToRY, August, 1903.  We take great pleasure
  in presenting this, the Twenty-Second Volume of the Leadville City Directory, published
  continuously by our firm. The in- formation contained in this volume is of great
  value to the merchant in the city whom it places in communication with every resident
  of the city and sur- roundings. It contains a complete classified business department
  of each person engaged in any line of trade, arranging him with his contemporaries,
  making a complete list of each particular line of business.  _ The Directory contains
  all information that is daily required by the inhabitants and those who have business
  or social intercourse with them. The old maxim, “Every man to his trade,” applies
  with full force to directory mak- ing, for in no line of business is experience
  more necessary than in directory work. The knowledge gained by us during the thirty-one
  years, devoted ex- clusively to directory making, has been used to the most excellent
  advantage in the production of this volume.  The Directory is a semi-public institution
  in which the entire population is represented and interested. It is used by all
  classes and conditions of people in every locality in the city and throughout the
  country, and by every stranger who comes within these limits. Furthermore, it is
  the custom of directory publishers to maintain directory libraries in all the principal
  cities in the Union by exchanging with each other, and the Leadville Directory will
  be sent to all directory libraries throughout the Union, where it may be con- sulted
  by thousands who seek such information.  Every business and professional man should
  spend some of his leisure hours examining the Directory. He will find it full of
  profitable suggestions. Keep it in a convenient place for frequent reference. Use
  it often yourself and invite your customers to use it. It will extend your acquaintance
  and advertise your business, and your establishment will be more popular and profitable.  The
  liberal patronage given us by the merchants of the city shows con- clusively their
  prosperity, and we are greatly indebted to them for the possi- bilities of the excellent
  publication herewith presented.  Very respectfully yours, BALLENGER & RICHARDS. '

text: 'ON  An Immense Mother Vein.  NEW AND VALUABLE SUGGESTIONS REGARDING THE GEOLOGY
  AND MINERALOGY OF THE BELT.  By A. V. BOHN, M. E., Late Manager of the Matchless,
  Lucy B. Hussey and Star of Hope Mines.  HE present condition and prospects of mining
  in the Leadville District are  certainly gratifying to the people of Lake county,
  who have testified their faith in its mineral wealth through years of investment
  and toil, through evil and good report, through seeming adversity and serious doubt
  as to its ability to last longer and give forth further riches from its wonderful
  wealth, hidden under the iron hat or crown that covers it. It was not faith that
  promised those of us who stood by the guns future reward; it was facts. It was knowledge
  of the rocks and determination to hunt for and develop our great resources; that
  infor- mation that comes from close study, observation, effort, work, that prompted
  the patriotic, loyal miner to go on and in time receive his reward. It was that
  quality in man that makes pioneers, that opens up a country, that blazes the path
  to industry, and invites the locomotive, and encourages capital to invest and open
  up resources that make thousands happy and prosperous. That was the class of men
  who remained here and worked, and are now smiling at grief and hopeful of immediate
  reward. That reward is standing in the door, and bids all a hearty welcome.  The
  attractive series of articles which The Herald Democrat is now laying before the
  public can be continued indefinitely, and with constant profit to this community.
  The writers are all willing to concede that, so far, we are only get- ting peeps
  behind the curtain at a stage set with the possibilities of a century of active
  investigation, and, as time unfolds new facts to the inquiring mind of the actual
  worker, so, too, will the material for writers grow on and be read with ever-increasing
  interest and profit by a widening circle of intelligent readers.  Unquestionably
  there is, as yet, more of conjecture than assured knowledge with reference to the
  extent, character and probable course of the Gold Belt, which is inaccurately localized
  by the term ‘‘Ball mountain.”’ Indeed, there is much reason to believe that even
  ‘‘Lake County Gold Belt’ is too narrow to include the confines of this remarkable
  strip of country.  The characteristics of Ball mountain which differentiate it from
  the better known country hemming it in on the west side, is the strong ledge of
  quartz or quartzite cleaving through it, a course considerably west of north and
  east of south. This ledge, vein, upthrow or faulting, as is variously termed and
  recog- nized, is considered to extend at least from Weston pass, on the south, to
  the valley of the Arkansas, on the north, and it is claimed to appear still further
  north, even to the Holy Cross Mining District.  Already preparations are making
  for renewed prospecting all along the line '

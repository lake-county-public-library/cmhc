text: '18 KOKOMO, l  the several camps as to which should become the ac- knowledged
  town of the district. Carbonateville led the van, and Robinson''s Camp, backed by
  the famous Undine and Smuggler mines, followed closely in the line of progress.
  Nothing daunted by established ri- vals, however, Capt. Smith led his little band
  north- ward, following down the course of Ten Mile Creek, and pitched his tent upon
  the eastern slope of Sheep Mountain, just south of Kokomo Gulch.  Tt would seem
  that his intention at this time was not to establish a town, but simply to erect
  a base or center, from which supplies might be distributed to the mines of the company.
  However this might be, so evident were the advantages of location, that itwas |
  determined to here found a town, and with this view | a surveyor was engaged and
  a town plat of 320 acres Â° duly laid off Ata meeting of citizens Capt. Smith was
  elected Recorder of the embryo city, and from that time out his tent was fairly
  besieged by eager ap- plicants for town property. The fame of Kokomo spread. Leadville,
  filled to overffowing, contributed of her overplus. From Georgetown, Breckinridge,
  Montezuma and other surrounding camps men came by dozens and by scores to seek their
  fortunes within the welcoming arms of this child of the mountain top. Such was the
  rush that soon all eligible lots within many blocks of the center had been taken
  up, and property began to change hands. Startling as it may sound to eastern ears,
  within two weeks from the time the first tree was cut and the first trail broken,
  lots upon the main street sold away up in the hun- dreds.  Nor was this the result
  of a mere furore of spec- ulation. Earning his money in hardships, and often- times
  in peril, the western man throws it not away upon any chimera of passing fancy.

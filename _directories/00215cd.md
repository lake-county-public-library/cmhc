  they were abandoned. McNulty’s Gulch, however, has yielded to the wealth of this
  country over three million dollars. Its richness is not yetexhausted. Asin all rich
  placer diggings, the claims were rapidly purchased, one by one, until in a short
  time the entire gulch was in the hands of a few indi-  viduals, It finally became
  the property of Col. James McNassar & Co. After changing ownership several times,
  it eventually passed into the hands of the gen- tleman just aamed, in connection
  with two brothers B. F. and»Perry H. Brandon. They continued in the control of this
  rich gold bearing region during the past six years. The Brandons conducted the work
  assiduously in that time and made many important improvements. Their success in
  working the placer deposits of the gulch in the summer season was never without
  ample remuneration, but these earnings were for the most part spent during the winter
  months in excavating an immense tunnel, now over 1,800 feet in length, in the hope
  of striking some rich pay streak which would sooner or later contribute to make
  the parties interested the great Moneyed Kings of the Rocky Mountain region.  The
  suddenly acquired population of 1860 soon passed away from the Ten Mile region,and
  there were Jess than a dozen inhabitants who remained in the sol- itude of the surrounding
  hills, delving persistently and  . assiduously for the treasures that lay hidden
  beneath the surface of the ground. This continped till the summer of 1878, when
  the great carbonate excitement about Leadville induced such an influx of population
  to that place that soon the new-comers began to spread over the new country until
  they soon reached , The Ten MILE VALLEY and began prospecting the mountains around
  McNulty’s gulch for carbonates            "

text: 'INTRODUCTORY.  August, 1892.  _In presenting the Thirteenth Annual Directory
  of the City of Leadville, we feel that we are rendering the public a ser- vice that
  will not fail to be appreciated. In it will be found a record of the homes, places
  of business and business insti- tutions of the inhabitants of the Cloud City, as
  nearly perfect as it is possible for human ingenuity together with a liberal expenditure
  of money and yeare of experience to make it. During the thirteen years that have
  marked our career as pub- lishers of this work we have been conscientious in making
  the Directory reliable in every respect, and we are gratified to refer to the support
  accorded us during these years as  evidence of the acceptability and appreciation
  of our earnest â€™ efforts.  OFFIcr oF THE City DirEecTory, i.  We have cause for
  congratulation that while many of our cities have been decreasing in population
  during the depres- sion so generally felt in business circles throughout the country
  during the past two years, that Leadville has not only held her own, but shows an
  increase in directory names over the year previous, our business houses are prosperous,
  and perhaps there is no city of its size that will compare with us in a business
  way.  In conclusion, we desire to express to our subscribers and the business community
  our cordial acknowledgments for the generous support accorded us, and to our private
  citizens for their kind and courteous treatment during the arduous task of collecting
  the matter contained in this work, we return sincere thanks.  THE PUBLISHERS.    '

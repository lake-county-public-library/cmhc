text: 'Trends to the North.  VIEWS OF A PRACTICAL MINING MAN REGARDING THE EXTENT
  AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE BELT.  By R. E. TAFT, M. E.  AN enthusiast on the great
  Gold Belt has suggested to me that I might add one to the series of articles which
  have appeared in your paper, and on a section of our country which has heretofore
  escaped attention.  Those who have written up this Gold Belt have followed it from
  Granite northeast to Birdseye gulch, where it seems to disappear, to come to the
  surface again at Breckenridge.  The belt does not end at Birdseye, but trends to
  the north, due to the abrupt raise of the spur or range of mountains between the
  Arkansas and the Tennessee branch of that river. The territory covered in by this
  section of the belt includes Birdseye and Buckeye gulches and sections 1, 2, part
  of 3, townships 9 and 13, 14, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 34, 35 and 36, township 8,
  and from Tennessee pass down over Taylor and adjoining hills, in Eagle county.  The
  difficulty attending the development of this part of the belt has been more in the
  nature of ignorance of the situation than lack of effort.  One has but to look at
  the enormous amount of fruitless development work on Breece hill in connection with
  the strike in and phenominal richness of the Little Johnnie mine (which is the key
  to the entire Gold Belt), to be reminded of the fact that no part of a great mineral
  zone that has been so productive as ours in this county should be considered worthless
  because misdirected work has failed to bring immediate returns.  The territory I
  have described was covered with prospectors during the boom of â€™79. Reports of strikes
  of gold ore of wonderful richness were of daily occur- rence, and these reports
  were invariably accompanied with assay certificates that left no doubt of that fact.
  These assays were taken from float in the wash and small pockets of ore found in
  gashes in the lime and quartzite; but all efforts to find a large body of this ore
  were futile, however, and it is the purpose of this article to explain the reason
  for this failure. Either the dynamical forces that brought the spur range to its
  present altitude were of a later period than the rise of the Saguache and Park ranges,
  or the shock and eruption were more severe, for the lime and quartzite formations
  are badly broken up.  The lime in many places lies in detached masses here and there
  on the quartz- ite, and in many instances prospectors have drifted on 4 promising
  contact only to find their headings abruptly ending in a face of wash, while the
  work done where the lime-porphyry formations are sufficiently large and stable to
  justify a belief that reliable ore bodies could be found was far above the plane
  of contact, and was, therefore, a useless expenditure of energy.  The greater part
  of the pay ore chutes of this district lie in the lower quartzite, the granite,
  and on the contact between the two. In some places the Archean '

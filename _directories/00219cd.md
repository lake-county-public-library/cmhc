  Car- bonateville Daily Ten Mile Mews. Several hotels are already built, which furnish
  ample accommodations - for the traveling public; while during the summer a; first
  class hotel will be erected and be known as the “Delmonico of the Pacific.” This

  as to view the magnificent wonders of this health giving section of the country.

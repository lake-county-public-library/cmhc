text: 'INTRODUCTORY  OFFIcE oF THE CITY DIBEOTORE, } August, 1901  This is the Twentieth
  Volume of the Leadville City Directory, and the experience of the past has been
  used to advantage in the preparation of this edition, and it is therefore confidently
  believed that it will prove superior to its predecessors, and equal in every respect
  to any work of its kind.  There is probably no better medium than the City Directory
  for show- ing the advance in public and private interests from one year to another,
  and a study of our Table of Contents will show how fully this book keeps the tecord
  in all matters of interest to the public.  The best skill and experience have been
  employed in the collection and compilation of the names and other information, which
  is much more com- prehensive than is often included in a city directory.  The liberal-patronage
  given us by the merchants of the city shows con- elusively their prosperity, and
  we are greatly indebted to them for the possi- bility of the excellent publication
  herewith presented.  Very respectfully yours, THE PUBLISHERS. '

text: 'INTRODUCTORY.  and the inexhaustible quantities of rich mineral which surrounds     her,
  betokens an era of prosperity seldom equaled in the history of cities.  â€˜We have
  made no estimate of the population, feeling that the size of this volume is sufficient
  to convince the most skep- tical of the rapid growth and commercial importance of
  this wonderful city.  In view of the courtesy and patronage so generously ex- tended
  to us by the merchants and citizens of Leadville during the preparation of this
  tedious work, we return our sincere and  hearty thanks. C., H. & Co. '

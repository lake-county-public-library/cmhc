text: '14 THE LEADVILLE GOLD BELT.     placer miner. A gulch of one dimension—a golden
  line without breadth or thick- ness, yielding millions!  Big Evans, lying north,
  and lowa, to the south, are gulches of glacial erosion. The milling process of nature
  was not conducted in them as in the little great California. Rock, gold and all
  were carried down in and on the river of ice, to form the auriferous sands of the
  Arkansas. Had the operation of gravity been unrestrained, the gold would have sought
  its resting place upon the bedrock, and other millions would have been added to
  the production of early times. Despite this bodily removal of the scored rock, enough
  of the precious metal escaped from the icy fetters, and obeyed the natural law,
  to give evidence of the character of the robbed material. From one end to the other
  of these gulches, gold in small quantities can be “‘panned.’? Nature has thus declared
  that the miner may, within these boundaries at least, profitably expend his brain
  and brawn.  As the result of the belief in the possibility of discovering the source
  of the auriferous gravel in California gulch, two mines have been opened- -the Lilian,
  on Printer Boy hill, and the Antioch, on Breece hill. Prospecting and develop- ment
  in the former have been conducted mainly on the plane of contact between the limestone
  and the overlying eruptive rock. Some years since this work yielded large returns
  in ores bearing gold, silver and lead, the first named being, always, the predominant
  value. But a faulting or dislocation of the ore chute caused the loss of its line
  of continuance, and for several years the ‘‘contact’’ has been explored, in vain,
  for its recovery.  Within the past year, prospecting has been carried on at a somewhat
  greater geological depth, resulting in the discovery of ore of a different character
  from that mined directly under the upper porphyry, yielding better values in gold,
  but with little or no silver or lead. These lower runways of ore are closely associated
  with or enclosed within intruded porphyrys. It would now seem that wherever these
  intrusions occur there is a reasonable probability that persistent search will result
  in the discovery of gold ores of value. It is not improbable that even in their
  downward extension into the primitive rock these dikes will continue to carry such
  minerals, not only on Printer Boy hill, but also on the hills to the north and south
  of it. The twistings, turnings and erratic offshoots of these junior porphyrys,
  as they have sought for the lines of least resistance, must be patiently followed
  in whatever horizon they may show themselves. A notable instance is that of the
  Printer Boy vein, standing wholly in secondary porphyry, which produced large gold
  values from the surface downward, until the vein was lost, or, as tradition says,
  encountered an “‘underground river’? which could not be handled with the pumping
  appliances then in use.  The gold ores of the Antioch mine are also found in the
  porphyry. Values are carried in a cement injected into or deposited by aqueous agency
  in a brec- ciated zone on a fault plane. The gold-bearing portion of the vein-filling
  is of high grade, but the broken pieces of enclosed valueless country rock make
  up so large a proportion of the mass which must be mined that the resulting product
  for milling purposes has generally too little gold in it for profit. The valuable
  mineral on this property will be found where the cement came from, probably where
  the porphyry rests in the sedimentary strata.  The great gold mine of the camp lies
  on the extension northeasterly of a line drawn from the Lilian through the Antioch.
  It is known as the Ibex consolida- tion, or perhaps more generally as the ‘“‘Little
  Johnny.’’ This property has been recently described by its able manager. His article
  should be read by al! who take an interest in the coming greatness of Leadville
  as a gold camp. '

text: '18 THE LEADVILLE GOLD BELT.     here indicated, and we may reasonably hope
  that the coming season will add greatly to our definite knowledge of the extent
  and course of this great ledge.  It has been known for a quarter of a century that
  gold existed in every gulch leading down from the mountains that rise east of us,
  and, I believe, a little reflection on the part of those who have had occasion to
  see where placer work has been done in these gulches will teach that extensive—-and
  therefore profita- ble—placer mining has never been carried on higher up than the
  line of this ledge. Further, the float, or specimen gold, of which every miner has
  heard, has almost invariably been found in its vicinity. Finally, the vein itself
  is known to pan or assay quite strongly in many places, from the vicinity of the
  Continental Chief up and over Ball mountain, Little Ellen hill, and along the backbone
  of the divide, on Mosquito pass, at the head of Little and Big English and French
  gulches. These facts, which pick and shovel and shrewd observation have been demonstrating
  for years, are at the bottom of a strong belief in the minds of many that this ledge
  is the source of the gold ores of the east side. Mind you, | am not disposed to
  venture an opinion at variance to the scientific gentlemen who have written upon
  this Gold Belt, as to the main source of the gold. Upon this question great men
  differ, and I have strong convictions upon this subject, to be advanced further
  along.  Coming down to the discoveries around which is growing the town of Ibex,
  we find many geological conditions which the Breece hill region holds in common
  with the well-developed hills lying between Breece and this city. The various porphyrys
  and limes occur with more or less regularity, and in connection with them are found
  the silver-lead ores which have already made this district famous, with this difference
  only, that they carry higher gold values. But, in addition, the Little Johnnie has
  opened up a class of ore heretofore practically unknown to this district. Development
  work has shown an unusual and very extensive dis- turbance of the older formations
  above mentioned. It is now evident that they have been fractured in every direction,
  and the displacement is both vertical and lateral to a degree unknown in the older
  workings of this district. Hence the difficulty of determining the trend or course
  of mineral chutes, for the ores occur between porphyry walls, under the porphyry,
  down into the lime; in fact, we are not able to say yet where they are nof deposited.
  The trite saying, that ‘silver is in veins and gold where you find it,’’ receives
  a new lease of life from the Gold Belt. No theory yet advanced to explain the facts
  already established with reference to the Gold Belt, has more---not to say as much—of
  the satisfying quality as this: The quartzite ledge is an immense mother vein, strong
  enough, extensive enough, to have disturbed the pre-existing conditions, in many
  parts, thousands of feet away from itself. The so-called deposits, adjacent to and
  apparently away from it, are simply displacements of the older formations by the
  dynamic forces that resulted in the main ledge. It is extremely probable that gold
  ores will yet be mined from the ‘‘grass roots’? on Breece hill—certainly up to the
  wash. And when deeper working, down, downward and into Ball mountain, have disclosed
  the true vein, or chimney in the vein, the results already attained augur the probability
  of mining on a scale hitherto unknown, even in this world-wide known camp of phenomenal
  silver and lead production, perhaps, indeed, such as have rarely been seen on this
  or any other continent. Might we not endanger, by this threatened gold production,
  our fair land, now languishing from ruinous legislation in the management of our
  national finances? Even now the eastern papers are alarmed lest we produce so much
  gold that we may unsettle values, destroying industries and foreign commerce! '

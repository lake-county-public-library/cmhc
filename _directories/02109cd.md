text: 'cad  INTRODUCTORY.  Orricre oF THE City DIRrEcToRy, â€˜ , JuLY 18, 1886.  The
  publishers, in submitting the seventh volume of the Leadville City Directory, feel
  confident that it will be received with the same favor that has been accorded our
  previous issues. The encouragement heretofore given has led us to spare no ex- pense
  or painstaking to render as perfect as possible the infor- mation contained in its
  pages, that it may continue to be found a reliable and indispensable work of reference
  in all its depart- ments.  The work now presented gives the names and locations
  of 7,379 of our residents and business institutions, being an increase of 367 names
  over the previous issue. The city is showing her growth and prosperity by many improvements
  in the way of building, and our great mining resources are today of more im- portance
  than ever before. With these facts in view, we feel that we have reasons to congratulate
  our citizens upon this sat- isfactory evidence of our continued thrift, and to our
  patrons, the enterprising and public-spirited citizens of Leadville, we  return
  our sincere and hearty thanks. C. & B. '

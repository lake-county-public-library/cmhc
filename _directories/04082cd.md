text: 'THE FIRST GOLD ERA.  EXISTENCE OF THE PRECIOUS METAL IN THE LEADVILLE DISTRICT
  KNOWN FOR FORTY YEARS.  S has been very frequently pointed out, the Leadville Gold
  Belt is no new discovery. It is not an area manufactured for boom purposes, since
  the crash in silver, but a district that has had a rich and eventful history. The
  overwhelming importance of the silver and lead discoveries of Fryer, Carbonate and
  Iron hills, however, completely absorbed the attention of mining men, from 1877
  to 1893, and the really remarkable gold area was allowed to fall into com- t.! parative
  obscurity. The history of early placer mining in California gulch section of the
  Leadville - District, and the subsequent search for the source of the gold in the
  hills sur- rounding it, is not wholly dependent upon tradition, for there are still
  in Lead- ville several gentlemen who were identified with it. Prominent among these
  is \ Mr. Charles L. Hill, late manager of the A Y and Minnie mines, one of the f
  bonanza silver groups of the past decade and a half, and a practical mining man
  of large experience. He came to California gulch over thirty years ago, and has
  the distinction of having first systematically opened up the most important prop-
  erty on Printer Boy hill, now in the centre of the defined Gold Belt. What he says
  of the pioneer development of this section may prove a not uninteresting  closing
  chapter of this brochure:  Placer miners first came into the district in the latter
  part of the “''fifties,”’ and gulch mining was carried on at this end of California
  guich. Gradually the work was extended in the direction of what is now Oro, and
  some very rich finds were made in that vicinity. In the latter part of the "‘sixties,”’
  miners began to investigate the possibility of discovering lode claims in the side
  hills in the vicinity of the upper portion of California gulch. Attention was chiefly
  drawn to Printer Boy hill, south of the gulch, where some prospecting had been done,
  and where much of the surface dirt, a clayey, decomposed porphyry, could be sluiced,
  and yielded gold in paying quantities.  It was in 1868 when the first discovery
  was made in the Printer Boy lode, by Charles Mullen, a Prospector sent out by J.
  Marshall Paul. Up to that time the development work had been very slight on the
  hill, but this discovery of ore proved to be quite a stimulus. In those days prospecting
  was carried on upon an entirely different scale from the methods employed in fissure
  vein regions. In the latter, for instance, the prospector hunts for float, or loose
  pieces of rock that come from the vein, and by tracing these pieces, comes on to
  the outcrop. In the region about Printer Boy hill, the object of search was a yellow,
  iron-stained clay, found in the wash. This was followed down until hard rock was
  reached, and then the clay was followed until it turned down into the regular formation.
  This was the vein.  After the discovery by Mullen, Major DeMary and others sunk
  a shaft on the Printer Boy claim, and discovered a large body of ore. They took
  out in the neighborhood of $60,000. The ore was not smelted or assayed, but run
  through the sluices and treated by the old-fashioned arastra method. This satisfied
  the Printer Boy people that the claim was valuable, and another shaft was sunk.
  The two shafts were known as the upper and lower Printer Boy shatts. It was in the
  spring of 187: when I took hold of the Printer Boy property. When I assumed the
  management of the mine I found the upper shaft down 75 feet and the lower shaft
  down go feet. The level from the upper shaft was 200 feet, and the lower shaft had
  a level of 150 feet. These two levels I connected. That constituted the development
  of the mine, and on it all the work was done. During the fourteen months that I
  had charge of the mine, with thirty men working, I took out $116,000 in gold.  Continuing
  his description of the Printer Boy mine, Mr. Hill said:  The vein was 20 inches
  wide. It was decomposed porphyry and iron, of a clayey consistency, the walls being
  of pyritiferous or grey porphyry. At a depth of 150 feet the vein was regular from

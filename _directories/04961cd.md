text: 'INTRODUCTORY.  OFFICE OF THE CITY SD TRROTORY, | August, 1898.  With the publication
  of the Seventeenth Annual Volume of the Leadville City Directory the publishers
  desire to return their sincere thanks for the good-will and patronage so generously
  extended to them in the support of a work so essential and convenient to both citizen
  and stranger, and we acknowledge that it is somewhat flattering to the publishers
  to know that our earnest endeavor for so many years to give the public a work that
  would meet their approval, has been appreciated and acknowledged by their continuous
  support.  It is our opinion that the clouds, which have darkened the prosper- ity
  of our mining interests for so long, are gradually passing away and the future seems
  brighter than for many years. The opening up of new bodies of ore with which our
  City is so bountifully surrounded, which has been gradually going on during the
  last year, together with the drainage of the lower mines, which will furnish increased
  employment to our miners and thus add to our commercial interests, which in due
  time will be realized by our merchants, should stimulate us all to look forward
  to a revival of the prosperity of the glorious past, and remind the world that we
  are still the greatest mining camp in existence.  Hoping that we are not too sanguine
  in our ideas of the immediate prosperity awaiting the Cloud City, and again expressing
  our apprecia- tion of the many courtesies annually extended to us for so many years,
  we are  Very Respectfully,  BALLENGER & RICHARDS. '

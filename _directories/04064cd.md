  this latter area being almost entirely unexplored territory, but equally promising
  as an area worthy of future explor- ation.  The geological structure of the district
  is shown on the section map, which is made a part of the map of the Leadville Gold
  Belt, and which is drawn from the city of Leadville easterly through Carbonate,
  Iron, Breece and Little Ellen â€” hills, and penetrates the center line of the great
  silver ore deposits, as well as through the Gold Belt itself. The formation of the
  Gold Belt is shown to be a continuation, and part of the same geological structure
  and of the same ore chutes as are found in Carbonate and Iron hills. This formation,
  briefly stated, con- sists essentially of a succession of metamorphic and sedimentary
  rocks, or quartz- ites, and limestones, which rest upon the older granite. Between
  and across these strata have subsequently been forced enormous and numerous flows
  of porphyry, which split and crossed the sedimentary formations in the shape of
  dikes, horizontal sheets and overflows. These porphyrys were ejected in inter- mittent
  eruptions over ages and ages of time. After them came the mineral- bearing waters
  and gases which permeated the neighboring rocks, and following the cracks and lines
  marked out by the porphyrvs, dissolved out portions of the more soluble formations,
  and deposited their metallic contents of silver, lead and gold in their stead. Then
  the faulting and general uplifting, of which the Mosquito range is the local core
  or center, took place, and finally the settling and surface erosion, which has brought
  the ore bodies nearer to the surface, and left them so accessible to mining operations,
  as we now find them.  It is now a well-understood fact in Leadville mining that
  the close observation of these porphyry dikes and intrusions is a most important
  requirement of suc- cessful prospecting. They are found everywhere in the district,
  wherever ore has been found, but are more varied and numerous in the eastern portion
  and in the Gold Belt, and probably occurred after the manner of modern volcanoes,
  with ages of time intervening between their eruption. These porphyrys themselves,
  as shown in the great variety of them, differ one from another, as did, probably,
  their resulting ore deposits. Thus, one deposit may have caused the deposit of a
  preponderance of silver, another of lead and zinc, and others of gold, all of which
  were distributed, successively, throughout the same general ore chutes or horizons.
  It also appears that the younger and smaller flows had the greatest influence upon
  the ore depositions, and that the gold values have been arrested and held nearer
  these dike porphyrys, and even in some of the porphyrys them- selves, and the variety
  and differing ages of these porphyrys may account for the varying character of the
  ores in adjacent ore deposits, or, as has been often observed, in the same continuous
  ore chutes. Had this not been so, the con- clusion is hard to resist that the ore
  deposits would have been more uniform and homogeneous in character than we now find
  them.  In the Leadville Gold Belt these conditions are found to a more marked degree
  than in the other portions of the district, and are shown on the section map, the
  heavy black lines representing the frequent intrusions of the younger or dike porphyrys,
  cutting across and between the same limestones and quartzites explored further west,
  the material difference between this area, in geological formation, and the remainder
  of the district, being in the frequency and variety of these eruptives, which, on
  account of their gold-bearing and depositing quali- ties in this region, seem to
  insure a greater gold deposition with a combination of the other metals.  The Leadville
  Gold Belt, therefore, may be compared to a big plum pudding,       "

  by hundreds within a radius of a few miles, but these ten bid fair to attain a national
  ce-~ lebrity.  But we need not go even to the adjacent moun- tains to find mineral.
  During the latter part of April the workmen of Messrs. Ware and Ketchum, while digging
  a foundation for their building upon the cor- ner of Ten Mile Avenue and Kokomo
  Street, in the very heart of the town, struck a true fissure vein some four feet''in
  width, assaying from 311 to 728 ounces of silver to the ton. This mine, named by
  the proprie- tors, “ fennie W,” bids fair to become one of the great paying mines
  of the State.  Thus backed by mineral wealth of incalculable amount; surrounded
  with vast mountain ranges teem- ing with untold treasure which needs but the pick
  and shovel of the enterprising miner for immediate devel~- opment, Kokomo must and
  will become a great and flourishing city. Just three months from the time Capt.
  Smith and his party first broke trai] into camp the election for incorporation was
  held and a vote polled more than double in number than polled by Leadville at the
  first election one year before. With such a record in her brief past, who shall
  limit her future ?          '

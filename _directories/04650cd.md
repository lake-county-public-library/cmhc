text: 'INTRODUCTORY.  OFFICE OF THE CITY DIRECTORY, | August, 1897.  The publication
  of the Leadville City Directory for the year 1896 was omitted in consequence of
  the recent labor troubles which extended over that portion of the year at which
  we make the canvass for this work, and which of necessity would bring about such
  a change in the inhabitants of the city as to render the directory of little service
  to our patrons, we therefore decided that the existing conditions demanded the suspension
  of the work for the year.  It should be taken as an evidence of the substantiality
  of our min- ing interests, which have built up and sustained the city, to see that
  we have overcome the attendant evils of this unfortunate affair, as well as that
  of the panic of 1893, either of which would have wiped out of exist- ence 2 mining
  city less fortunately situated, and we are pleased to note that the outlook for
  the future seems brighter than for many years. Our houses are well filled, and the
  increase of the number of names contained in this volume gives conclusive evidence
  of a gain in our population which should be not only satisfactory but quite flattering
  under exist- ing circumstances.  It may perhaps be unnecessary to say to our old
  patrons that the present volume has been prepared with the greatest care for its
  accu- racy and usefulness, and we shall in thefuture as we have during the past
  strive to merit the approval and patronage so generously extended to us during the
  sixteen years which has marked the existence of this publication.  With our sincere
  and grateful thanks for the many courtesies annu- ally extended to us by the inhabitants
  of the Cloud City, we are  Very respectfully, BALLENGER & RICHARDS. '

text: 'Its History and Geology.  Nor A NEW DISCOVERY, BUT A PART AND PARCEL OF THE
  FAMOUS SILVER AREA.     By MAX BOEHMER, M. E., Member of the American Institute
  of Mining Engineers.  JEADVILLE’S fame as a mining camp rests principally upon its
  large and  steady output of silver and lead-bearing ores, and but few people outside
  of the State know of its early fame as a gold producer. As early as 1860, and long
  before the discovery of the silver and lead deposits, the site of Leadville was
  known as ‘‘ Oro” and ‘* California Gulch.”’ At that time it was known as a gold
  district only, and gold in large quantities was mined. This gold came prin- cipally
  from the placers, 7. e., the loose debris in the gulches. Quite a respectable quantity
  of gold, however, was also taken from lodes or veins in rock in place The richer
  portions of these placers were exhausted more than twenty years ago, but ever since
  gold-washing has continued on a small scale, and the day is not far distant when
  the entire gulch will be re-worked extensively. The gold- bearing veins which were
  worked in that early day were few, but very rich, and the common opinion is that
  they were not exploited properly in depth.  The discovery of large deposits of silver-bearing
  lead ores, in 1877 and 1878, on the very site and in the immediate vicinity of the
  old gold camp of Oro, created the well-known excitement of that day. The fame of
  the gold camp was obscured by the larger fame of the silver camp, and the existence
  of gold on the site of Leadville was forgotten by all except the inhabitants, and
  even they neglected the development of the Gold Belt, and spent all their energies
  upon the exploration of the silver veins, which, owing to their size and value,
  seemed to promise larger returns than the gold veins.  The gradual, but steady,
  decline in the value of silver, since the discovery of the Leadville silver deposits,
  soon drew the attention of mining men back to the original Gold Belt, and the disastrous
  fall in silver, caused by the closing of the Indian mints and the repeal of the
  Sherman law, concentrated their energy and ~ created the determination to explore
  the Gold Belt to its fullest extent. This change of attitude is already plainly
  visible in the figures which give the output of Leadville. The value of the gold
  mined from 1878 to 1891 probably never exceeded $250,000 during any one year, but
  this has increased to $400,000 in 1892, and #g00,000 in 1893, with good reason to
  believe that the output of Lead- ville will reach $1,500,000 gold during 1894.  The
  Gold Belt of Leadville is not, as one would suppose at first sight, a newly discovered
  district, a region of rock and geological formation entirely different from that
  of the Silver Belt. It is, on the contrary, part and parcel of the great deposit
  so well known for its wealth in silver and lead, and represents a section of it
  which, in addition to the silver and lead, also carries gold. It immediately    '

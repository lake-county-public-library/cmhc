text: 'How It All Came About.  GOLD IN THE MOUNTAIN- TOPS. TO THE EAST OF US AND TO
  THE WEST OF US.  By TINGLEY S. WOOD, Owner of the Lilian, Antioch and other properties.     [EADVILLE
  has, for so many years, held the chief place among silver pro-  ducers that the
  world has grown to regard it as that only. Even the less valuable metal from which
  its name is derived has, of late, been mined in such small quantity that this camp
  has ceased to be a factor in the lead market. In the minds of those whose attention
  is directed to such matters, ‘‘Leadville’’ and “‘silver” are synonyms. To the opponents
  of the use of the white metal for monetary purposes, this region is the mining Nazareth,
  out of which no good can come; the men who struggle with the earth, to wrest from
  her secret hiding places the once regal but now degraded metal, are the pariahs
  of finance. These followers of the worship of Aaron have never known, or have forgotten,
  that from a very small strip of the now-despised territory there has been taken,
  nearly half a century ago, enough material for the casting of many golden idols.
  Those were yellow rays whose shining first attracted the eyes of men to the mountain-
  top where now we live. Though since obscured and lost in the white effulgence of
  the reflection from the mountains of silver brought from the deeps to the sun- light,
  they are now once more visible by reason of the legislative tarnish which has dimmed
  the sometime greater splendor. Yielding to the stronger arm, we will, for a time,
  turn our backs upon our greater love, and prepare to hur! nug- gets and bars of
  gold at the walls of incredulity, until a breach shall be made through which the
  lights of Leadville shall again dazzle all eyes.  To do this, we must go a little
  higher up on the mountains—where the snows are deeper and the winds colder—where
  additional determination and patience are called for, to uncover the more closely
  guarded storehouses of Nature, which hold the metal that is striving to rule alone.
  Gold is in the mountain-tops to the east of us and to the west of us. The great
  wedge of granite thrust up on the westerly side of the mountain valley where we
  have our homes gives plentiful evidence of certain reward to persistent searchers.
  The surface showings at Twin Lakes and Lackawanna and Half Moon gulches would cause
  a rush of pros- pectors were they farther off and more inaccessible. They lack only
  the enchant- ment of distance. Doubtless, the untried portions of the great range
  in which they are situated contain many more equally favorable localities, ready
  and wait- ing to exchange treasure for labor. Naturally, the range to the east is,
  at the present time, receiving more attention. The foothills at its base have been
  turned inside out in the search for silver-bearing minerals, and the progress of
  mining development has been, for the most part, toward the higher ground. In this
  direction, also, points the golden finger of California gulch—that little insig-
  nificant water-track which, decades ago, yielded such marvelous returns to the    '

text: "            LEADVILLE, 9  daily newspapers furnish mental pabulum for extensive
  circles of critical readers.  Without proceeding into the statistical details of
  individual enterprises, which is hardly within the scope of such a work as this,
  the reader can form a pretty accurate idea of the extent and character of the business
  carried on in Leadville, by scrutinizing the list of names with their occupations,
  which at great labor, and with much care. we have prepared and set forth in this
  work.  The field in and around Leadville for judicious investment is still quite
  extensive, and opportunities are frequently presenting themselves to be taken advan-
  tage of by the sagacious and energetic capitalist. In conclusion we can safely reiterate
  that Leadville is one of the marvels of the present age.          "

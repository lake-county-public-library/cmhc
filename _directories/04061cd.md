text: '2.)  THE NEW ERA IN MINING.  MINING the precious metals, in the Leadville District
  at least, is no longer a haphazard under-  taking, but now nearly approximates a
  fixed science. Within its circumscribed borders there have been expended, for labor
  alone, more than fifty millions of dollars, while not less than seven millions additional
  have been put into timbers for the support of stopes and drifts from which have
  been taken the princely sum of two hundred millions in silver values—new wealth
  created and added to the world’s treasure. It is true that Chance led to the first
  discovery of gold in the sands of California gulch, when, in 1859-60, it was overrun
  with hardy prospectors from the limited placer tields of Cherry creek, the Mecca
  of the Pike''s peak pilgrims of that historic period. But ever since the exhaustion
  of those surface deposits, Reason and Science have directed the miner to the greater
  treasure vaults concealed beneath the alluvial wash of less remote eras of time.
  The pioneer pros- pector, with perhaps more of instinct than of knowledge, reasoned
  that the source of the gulch gold must be looked for above rather than below the
  surface of the stream, and this natural inspiration sufficed to strengthen human
  ambition and to sustain human endeavor until Science, applied and pure, came in
  to confirm the intuitive and the instinctive logic of the unlettered era of the
  primitive seeker of the golden fleece. The unlooked-for intrusion of vast carbonate
  deposits between the auriferous sands of the valley and the imprisoned mother veins
  of the higher range served to delay their suc- cessful pursuit for a decade or more,
  and in the unparalleled harvest of the less-precious metal, fully compensating in
  quantity for the absence of quality, the search for gold was almost wholly abandoned,
  and the theories of its existence, possibly at greater depths than had yet been
  attained, were quite Jost sight of. But for the steady decline in the value of silver,
  occasioned by its rejection as a money metal by many of the great nations of the
  earth, and its partial demonetization by others, the resump- tion of the search
  for gold might have been postponed for yet a number of decades. What might otherwise
  have been regarded as an unmixed calamity, therefore, has proven something in the
  nature of a blessing in disguise; for, within less than a twelvemonth from the date
  of the financial crisis, we are called upon to witness the transformation of ‘the
  greatest silver mining camp on earth’’ into the largest gold producer in the State,
  with scarcely a rival on the Continent.  How this all came about, and what may be
  confidently looked for in the immediate and more remote future, is told in succeeding
  pages of this brochure, by men who hazard professional reputa- tions of inestimable
  value upon their statements of fact and their guarded ventures in the realms of  rational
  conjecture.  LEADVILLE, June 1, 1894.  COPYRIGHTED 1894, BY C,H. MORSE. '

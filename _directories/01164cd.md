text: 'INTRODUCTORY.     OFFICE OF THE Crty DrIREcrorRyY, July, 1888.  In submitting
  the ninth annual volume of the LEapVILLE Ciry Dirsecrory for the inspection and
  use of the public, we feel confident that it will be received with the same generous
  favor that has been accorded its predecessors. We have spared neither labor nor
  expense to make it reliable and useful to our patrons as well as creditable to ourselves
  and the city, and believe it will be found equally satisfactory, if not superior
  to our former issues. We are pleased to note the prosperous condition of our mountain
  city and will take this occasion to return our sincere thanks for courtesies and
  favors  extended to us. THe PusrisueErs. '

text: 'INTRODUCTORY.  We take pleasure and considerable pride in presenting for the
  consideration of the people of Leadville this our Twenty-ninth Volume of the City
  Directory.  While the City Directory has come to be more and more an indispensable
  feature of modern business and social life, few people realize the vast amount of
  research and painstaking effort necessary to produce a work such as this.  We extend
  our thanks to the people of Leadville for their uniform courtesy to our solicitors
  in quest of information and the merchants for their generous patronage to make a
  work of this kind possible, and trust it is well deserved and will prove a good
  investment.  Respectfully, BALLENGER & RICHARDS. '

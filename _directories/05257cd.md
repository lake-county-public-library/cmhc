text: 'ya 8Â°  INTRODUCTORY.  OFFICE OF THE City DIRECTORY, August, 1899.  With the
  issue of the eighteenth volume of the Leadville City Directory we are pleased to
  congratulate our citizens not only upon the increased num- ber of names contained
  in this work, but also that the surrounding conditions, together with the activity
  now exhibited in our mining interests, are such that we consider ourselves justified
  in predicting a period of unexampled prosperity for the inhabitants of the Cloud
  City, which we hope may extend over a period of many years. Our mining interests
  were never in a more prosperous and satisfactory condition than at the present time,
  with the water out of our lower mines and the facilities for treating the ore at
  the smelters, employment will soon be furnished to many more than are at present
  employed. With such conditions the outlook for the immediate future seems much brighter
  than ever before in the history of the city, and we believe that the demand for
  labor during the ensuing year will be such that many will be added to our population.  Hoping
  that we are not too sanguine in our predictions for the most substantial mining
  camp in existence, we shall look with confidence to the future to prove our assertions.  It
  is perhaps unnecessary for ua to say to our old patrons that the work upon this
  volume has been done with the utmost care, and we believe that it will be received
  with the same generous approval that has been accorded to its predecessors for many
  years. We desire to express our sincere thanks to those who have so generously responded
  to our call for the support of thia work, and also to our private citizens who have
  so kindly extended the facilities for collecting the information contained in it.  Very
  respectfully,  BALLENGER & RICHARDS. '

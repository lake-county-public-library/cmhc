text: '22 THE LEADVILLE GOLD BELT.     and Cambrian rocks come together with few traces
  of mineralization, while in others there is a strata of a species of quartzose between
  them that seems to be a mixture of fragments of the Archean and pre-Cambrian sediment.
  Four years ago the leading geologists of the world decided that this strata should
  be classi- fied and named, and it is now known as the Algonkian formation. The fissure
  veins in the granite have a general course of south 12° east. The lateral or cross
  veins range from east to north 77° east. The lateral veins are small but clearly
  defined and regular, and have a pitch of 45°, while the others are of the nature
  of dikes of quartz, porphyry, spar, copper and gold. The overflow from these veins
  is found in the pre-Cambrian or Algonkian strata and up in the quartzite fissures.
  The scattered developments from which these facts are obtained show that sys- tematic
  work on this quartzite contact will prove remunerative.  The work done in this locality
  in the early days demonstrates that, outside of the placers—some of which have been
  worked every summer during the last thirty-three years—it is no place for a prospector
  of limited means; yet, owing to the higher lift of the formations and light deposits
  of wash, the cost of explora- tion work is much fess than in other places on the
  belt. The statements herein are not based upon theory, but from my own experience
  and knowledge of the formations and the annual examinations of the limited work
  done during the last fifteen years, and, with this understanding, I may safely offer
  the suggestion to those who may be disposed to organize prospecting enterprises
  for this branch of the belt, that work on the lime-porphyry contact should be confined
  to places where the porphyry is exposed to such an extent as to warrant the belief
  that the lime has not been too seriously disturbed, and to the quartzite contact.
  This contact is so clearly defined over a large area of the belt that there is little
  danger of a mistake or a loss.  The quartzite above the underlying veins has been
  metamorphosed into a soft brown sandstone, while the Algonkian strata is changed
  to a crimson red oxide and a yellow ochre, and this is a safe, reliable guide for
  shaft and tunnel work. The fissure veins referred to are practically undeveloped,
  while the Taylor and Buckeye hill sections have been producing gold ore since 1883.
  When we take into consideration the tremendous scope of this great belt, and its
  known value, and, in addition, the great copper-gold-silver area under the Silurian
  lime and Cambrian formations, and extending far down in the primitive granite, we
  may well believe that Mr. Campion’s estimate of the future gold output is a con-
  servative one, indeed.  The development of the copper-gold zone alone will, within
  three years, call for one or more new smelting plants in Leadville similar to the
  Argo works.  It is quite in line with the purpose of this article to say that the
  recent onslaught upon our great industry has attracted the attention of the people
  of all nations to the wonderful resources of the Rocky mountains.  It is safe to
  say that at least five years must pass before the people throughout the East recover
  from the effects of this panic. It has been a serious lesson, and for years they
  must, as a matter of necessity, practice the most rigid economy. There will be little
  or no demand for increased business facilities or industrial enterprises of any
  kind. The idle capital of our country must, in the very nature of things, find its
  way into investments in and the development of the mines of our State. It should
  be our purpose to encourage such investments, and unite in protecting them in every
  way; yet, at the same time, our experience of the past six months has taught us
  that the greater the number of pay mines in the hands of local owners the greater
  will be our home prosperity. '

text: 'PREFACE.  We present the Leadville City Directory for 1907, trusting that it
  will meet with approval and appreciation of our patrons and the general public.  This
  book we believe more completely represents the healthy growth of the city than any
  other medium that reaches the average citizen.  POPULATION.  This volume contains
  7,766 names.  By using a multiple of two, which would represent the women and children
  not included in our Directory canvass, would give a population of 15,532 for Leadville
  and immediate surroundings.  We wish to extend thanks for the liberal patronage
  bestowed upon the work, and for courteous treatment extended to our representatives.  BALLINGER
  & RICHARDS. '

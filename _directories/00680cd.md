text: 'INTRODUCTORY,  Orrice of THE Crrr Pamneron}  June, 1881.  ‘The continued popularity
  of Leadville as the most prosperous bullion producing section of the Rocky Mountains,
  together with her importance as a commercial centre, demands a better and higher
  degree of completeness in all her local institutions. Recognizing the justice of
  thia sentiment the publishers of this work, since its inanguration one year ago,
  have labored earnestly to increase its usefulness, and render it, as they trust
  they have, an indispensable item in every business ‘house and public office in Leadville.  The
  labor, care and expense which has been so generally bestowed on the volume now about
  to be dismissed on its mission, we are confident will satisfy all, of the earnestness
  and sincerity of our purpose, and demonstrates that the City Directory of Leadville,
  in all departments, stands in the front rank of its class, and it shall always be
  our aim to make it 2 complete mirror of the mining, commercial and professional
  interests of Leadville, producing in the briefest form a history of Leadville’a
  progress from year to year.  We congratulate our citizens upon the prosperous condition
  of the mines and the substantial prosperity so plainly visible in all branches of
  trade, and to our patrons, the enterprising and public spirited inhabitants of Leadville,
  we return our sincere and hearty thanks. . Cc &B. '

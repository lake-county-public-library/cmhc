  Under the magic touch of her modern alchemists, who, with knowledge, experience,
  and conviction for their craft, the.‘‘Gold Belt”? for their Jaboratory, and picks
  and shovels for their refining pots, Leadville’s silver has been changed into gold,
  making Leadville to-day the greatest gold-producing district in Colorado. This fact,
  remarkable and startling as it is true, is a record of noiseless, steady develop-
  ments and remarkable results, which have not been published broadcast, and would
  naturally seem incredible.  It is a fact, too, not yet well known or believed by
  the mining world, as the energy of Leadville’s miners has been directed to the rapid
  and wonderful accom- plishment of the now existing conditions, and little time has
  been wasted by them in the usual methods of building and booming a new mining camp.  To
  describe and trace out these conditions would be only to rehearse the admirable
  letters of Messrs. Boehmer, Campion, Wood, Noble and others; but it is a significant
  fact, not stated by them, that the great mines recently opened in Leadville, both
  in gold and silver, have been discovered and operated by Lead- ville men, and by
  the expenditure of Leadville money—by men who had studied and knew the district
  and its possibilities, and who had the energy and courage of their convictions.
  It is said that rats desert a sinking ship, because they know its dangerous condition
  first and best. The mining men of Leadville, who know it the best, never doubted
  its permanency and value, as compared with any other mining camp of the West. They
  know of no other district combining such vast resources and favorable conditions
  as are found in Leadville, and they never leave it until they go with their fortunes
  made, which they generally do. This is the greatest tribute possible to the worth
  and permanency of this great mining district.  The portion of the Leadville District
  from which the most of the gold is now mined, and which is becoming generally known
  as the Leadville Gold Belt, is a part and parcel of the same area, and on the same
  ore chutes, which in the past have furnished the millions of ounces of silver and
  tons of lead for which Lead- ville is justly celebrated.  It is impossible to draw
  any arbitrary lines, laying off and defining this ““Gold Belt,’”’? which in the
  conception of the term conveys an erroneous idea of a separate and distinct zone
  which is entirely gold-bearing, whilst the remainder, the ‘‘ Silver Belt,”’ is productive
  of silver and lead, and no gold. That portion of the district, however, in which
  the gold values seem to predominate in the ores, and where the yellow metal is more
  universally distributed, lies about two miles due east of the city of Leadville,
  on the western flank of the Mosquito or Park range, and, so far as developments
  now show, embraces the territory of Breece hill, Printer Boy hill, Florence hill
  and Little Ellen hill, an area of about four square miles. These hills are a part
  of a succession of round-top steps or bosses, which rise gradually from the Arkansas
  valley to the more precipitous flanks of the range on the east. They are bounded
  on their northern and southern sides by parallel gulches, running east and west
  from the summit of the range to the Arkansas valley, whilst their division from
  west to east is less distinct, and often follows the line of principal faulting
  in the district.  The topography and relative location of the Leadville Gold Belt
  is shown on the map accompanying this work. The heavy double shading represents
  approximately the area of the belt already producing and partially developed, and
  the circles the mines from which most of the gold has so far been extracted. The
  lighter shading''{indicates the extension of the gold-bearing formation further '

text: 'INTRODUCTORY.  OFFICE OF THE CITY DIRECTORY, } August, 1895.  With the issue
  of the Fifteenth Annual Directory of the City of Leadville the publishers are pleased
  that existing conditions at the present time are such as to warrant them in extending
  their hearty congratulations upon the business outlook and the general prosperity
  of the Cloud City. The general depression of the past two years which for a time
  threatened to almost annihilate our fair city has been over- come and prosperity
  continues to throw its invigorating rays about us, impelling us to go forward in
  search of the great mineral wealth hid- den immediately around us, and to-day we
  are no doubt the most pros- perous city of the West. Our great mining interests
  show more activity than for many years, giving employment to more men, thus causing
  our houses to be well occupied, our business places to be well patron- ized and
  a general condition of thrift to pervade about us. During the past year there have
  been erected some beautiful residences and many others have been rebuilt and beautified
  in such a manner as to indi- cate that our city is no longer a mere mining camp,
  but a city of per- manent homes, surrounded by mountains whose vast treasures of
  mineral wealth are at present attracting the capital of enterprising men from all
  parts of the world.  We are pleased to note that the most substantial evidence of
  our prosperity is indicated by the increase of our population since the pub- lication
  of the City Directory one year ago. The present volume con- tains 7,706 names, showing
  an increase during the year of 954 directory names, this enables us to place the
  population of our city at the pres- ent time at 14,488, which we consider as nearly
  accurate as an estimate can be made. We would say also that the canvass for this
  volume has been made with great care and the work will be found fully as reliable
  as its predecessors. In conclusion we desire to thank the business men for their
  continued support and liberal patronage, also the private residents for the many
  courtesies extended to us in the preparation of this work, and we promise to continue
  its publication as long as the  present congenial feeling exists. THE PUBLISHERS. '

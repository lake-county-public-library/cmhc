  OF THE CiITy DIRECTORY, September, 1905.  With the issue of the twenty-fourth volume
  of the Leadville City Directory we are pleased to note that the existing evidences
  of prosperity so plainly visible at the present time are such as to justify us in
  extend- ing our congratulations to the citizens of Leadville and all who are inter-
  ested in the great mining interests over which our city is built and sur- rounded.
  During the past year a new era in our mining industry has been developed, which
  has stimulated confidence in the permanency and extent of this branch of labor to
  such an extent that it has given employ- ment to a greater number of people, and
  caused activity in business con- ditions such as has not existed for years. These
  conditions reach out into all lines of trade, and its reviving influence is felt
  by all classes, causing our city to assume the active appearance of its former early
  years.  There is probably no better medium than the City Directory for showing the
  advance in public and private interests from one year to another, and a study of
  our table of contents will show how fully this book keeps the record in all matters
  of interest to the public, and the present volume gives indisputable evidence of
  our growth during the past year, as it contains an increase of over ten per cent.
  in the number of names over those contained in the 1904 issue. ~  We would here
  return thanks to our citizens for the cordial manner in which our efforts have been
  received for so many years, and to our patrons for their generous and substantial
  aid in the publication of this work.  Very respectfully yours.  BALLENGER & RICHARDS. "

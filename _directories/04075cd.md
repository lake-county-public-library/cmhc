  above the plane of the contact and entirely surrounded by porphyry.  It may be suggested
  that these ore bodies are simply replacements of frag- ments of limestone which
  have been floated to their present position by the molten porphyry, but in a large
  number of cases the composition and physical appearance of the ore precludes this
  theory, as it is identical with the structure and composition of partly decomposed
  porphyry, and the conclusion is hard to resist that certain of the porphyrys, in
  certain stages of decomposition, must have had the property of arresting the values
  from the mineralizing solutions. There has doubtless been considerable leaching
  and concentration of values in addition, as one frequently finds bodies of material
  which have all the outward appearance of ore, but lack only that very important
  element, gold. This fact, that porphyry carries ore, and can itself become ore under
  proper conditions, increases the field for promising prospecting in this locality
  to a very great extent, and suggests the possibility that still other rocks, heretofore
  unsuspected, may also prove to be gold carriers.  Breece hill cannot, in general,
  boast of being what is commonly called ‘‘a poor man’s mining district,’’ for several
  reasons: First, a depth of several hundred feet is in general necessary to reach
  the ore horizon; second, the hill has, so far, proved a wet one; third, because
  of the erratic occurrence of the ore bodies, prospecting and working is more difficult
  and expensive, and ground must necessarily be kept opened well ahead of the stopes,
  and this involves con- siderable extra expense. There can, therefore, be no greater
  folly than for claim- owners in this locality to give short leases at high royalties
  to men with small capital—unless it be for such men to take them. The large number
  of shafts which never reached anything, and yet were over ore-bearing ground, show
  the result which may be expected if this is done. Of course, this does not apply
  to the strip of ground near the outcrop of the contact.  The high prices and royalties
  asked by a large number of claim-owners is probably the greatest drawback which
  this locality now labors under, and this is largely brought about by the exaggerated
  tales which are current about the prop- erty of the Ibex company, commonly known
  as the Little Johnny mine. While it is undoubtedly true that this mine is one of
  the greatest producers that Lead- ville has ever known, it must be remembered that
  it took a very large investment of capital to bring it to its present condition,
  and that, for the reasons before given, the working expense is heavy. It shows us,
  however, what can be expected from enterprises of the sort, properly backed by money,
  and claim- owners in this vicinity can confer no greater benefit on the camp at
  large than by working their properties or inducing others to do so.  The development
  and gradual increase in the gold production of Leadville has been quietly taking
  place for the last year, without attracting much attention from the outside world.
  With the precedent already established, we are not unreason- able in expecting to
  see Breece hill the scene of great activity during the coming season, and already
  a small town of stores and boarding houses is rapidly grow- ing up there, in anticipation
  of the expected rush. At the present time, the daily shipment from this hill is,
  in spite of the bad roads, about 235 tons.  With possibilities before us of finding
  other mines, such as those mentioned, it is not surprising to see snow-shoe tracks
  already thick on the other portions of Breece hill and Ball mountain. This latter
  locality has received little attention, although considerable rich float has been
  found there, and we will be greatly surprised if the list of shippers is not materially
  increased before another winter.    '

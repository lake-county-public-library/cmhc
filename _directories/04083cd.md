  and south direction. I sank the upper shaft to nearly 200 feet, but found the vein
  all broken up. When I left, in 1873, there was still pay ore in sight.  The mine,
  in many ways, was most remarkable, and some wondertul pockets of rich mineral were
  opened up. In two months, with eight men working, | managed to take out $22,000.
  One evening some of the men came down to the cabin with three ordinary sacks of
  ore, calculated to hold fifty pounds each. Before washing the dirt, I picked out
  110 ounces of coarse gold, one nugget weighing six ounces. The washing yielded 50
  ounces more, making 160 ounces from 150 pounds, the whole being valued at $3,200.
  \ About this time Printer Boy hill was the bonanza section of the whole country,
  but it did not create intense excitement. The Five-Twenty was opened up and paying.
  The Lincoln was on the shipping list, and the Lower Printer Boy was considered next
  to the Printer Boy in point of value. It was owned by Captain Breece and Joseph
  and Thomas Wells. One lot of amalgam taken to Denver weighed 6o pounds. Ben. Bernard
  & Co. were working the Pilot. The famous pan of gold ore, which yielded 30 ounces
  of the precious metal, is a matter of history. This came from the Pilot property,
  and Mr. Bernard, who still lives at Oro, frequently tells of the rich harvest that
  he reaped from this property.  Regarding the mineral formation of the Printer Boy
  section, Mr. Hill gave the  following brief description of its characteristics:
  \ The hill is divided into two parts by a break known as the Pilot fault, which
  extends southeast and northwest, and further south cuts the Mike fault. The formation
  is practically the same as that of Breece hill, the entire country being covered
  by an immense sheet of pyritiferous porphyry. The big pay mines of the early days
  were located west of this fault, and none of them ever went to con- tact. The ore
  is not found in regular fissure veins, but in fractures in the porphyry. None of
  the work was carried on at great depth, the rich pockets that were opened up in
  the Printer Boy lying comparatively near the surface. The formation is practically
  the same on the east side, except that there had been a limestone uplift, which
  exposed that formation. Itis on this outcrop that the Lilian mine is being worked.
  \ In view of the facts detailed above, the question naturally arose as to the present
  value of properties on Printer Boy hill, and the chances for finding ore at greater
  depth. In regard to this, Mr. Hill stated that when he left the mine, in 1873, the
  Printer Boy was a good proposition. For various reasons it had never been worked
  steadily, but he knew no reason why ore should not be found there, or anywhere else
  on the hill. In the Crown Point, and the Stevens shaft of the Iron mine, the contact
  has been followed east toward Printer Boy hill, in which direction it dipped. The
  grey porphyry sheet was unquestionably of immense thickness. In the early part of
  the â€™80s, a shaft had been sunk on the Littler claim for 1,000 feet, and there was
  still no contact. This was the deepest shaft in that section. If exploration should
  ever prove up the contact, Mr. Hill believed that it would demonstrate the existence
  of large and rich ore bodies, as large, possibly, as those in the Little Johnnie.
  The gold of California gulch, which has proved such a valuable addition to the wealth
  of the district, comes from the disintegration of Printer Boy and Breece hills.
  \ Mr. Hill estimates that before the Leadville excitement $300,000 in gold was produced
  from Printer Boy hill. Besides the mines already mentioned, several properties had
  been opened up in other portions of the district. Among these was the Breece Iron
  mine and the Great Western, which latter was operated by Joseph and William Pierce.

text: "   INTRODUCTORY.  OFFIcE oF THE City DirEcTory, August, 1891.  The twelfth
  annual volume of the Leadville City Directory has little in its outward appearance
  to distinguish it from its predecessors, but a careful examination of its contents
  will reveal many changes, such as annually occur in all important commercial centers.
  Many whose names formerly graced its pages have gone from our midst, and others
  have come to fill their places, while a few whose names have been recorded for many
  years have been removed by the relentless hand of Death,  The importance and business
  requirements of a City Directory are readily seen and acknowledged by all, yet very
  few of those who find it so useful have any conception of the arduous task of collecting
  and arranging the matter intelligibly and the amount of labor and constant care
  required to produce a work of this class which will stand the critical test to which
  it is daily and hourly subjected. It has been our aim to make this work as nearly
  accurate and reliable as personal supervision and years of experience can make it,
  and we believe that in point of accuracy and detail it is excelled by none.  We
  wish, however, to impress an important fact upon the minds of those consulting the
  Directory for information which they do not readily find, that all names are arranged
  in strict alphabetical order, according to the manner in which they are spelled,
  and not as they are pronounced, therefore one should know the correct spelling of
  the name to be able to find it easily.  Feeling that the present volume will receive
  the same cordial approval that has been accorded its predecessors, we desire to
  return our sincere thanks for the generous considera- tion received for so many
  years at the hands of the enterprising and hospitable inhabitants of the Cloud City.

text: 'INTRODUCTORY.  OFFICE OF THE CITY IRECTORY, } August, 1894.  The publication
  of the Leadville City Directory for 1893 was omitted in consequence of the uncertainty
  existing, both in mining and business circles, occasioned by the sudden fall in
  the price of silver which occurred about a year ago, causing many to predict the
  abso- lute abandonment of our chief mining industry and the consequent decay of
  the greatest mining camp on the continent.  Leadville was looked upon until now
  as being exclusively a silver mining camp and she consequently stood trembling in
  the balance, with her chief industry crippled, and her prestige apparently lost.
  But the energetic men who have been connected with the mining interests of Leadville
  since its earliest days, began to look for the source of the yellow metal, which
  attracted the miner to California Gulch before the existence of Leadville, and their
  labors have been crowned with such success that scarcely one year from the date
  of the financial crisis we find “ the greatest silver mining camp on earth” transformed
  into the largest gold producer in the State. Truly there is but one Lead- ville.  We
  are pleased to refer to the following pages, entitled the “Lead- ville Gold Belt,”
  recently compiled by Mr. C. H. Morse, the genial pro- _ prietor of that excellent
  and well-known hostelry, the Hotel Vendome.  It contains sectional maps of what
  is now known ag the gold belt as well as the opinion of some of the leading mining
  men and mining engineers who have been connected with the camp almost since its
  existence and whose statements may be considered reliable and trust- worthy.  We
  would say, also, that the present volume has been prepared with the usual care and
  will be found to be fully up to the standard of accuracy which has characterized
  our efforts for the past thirteen years as publishers of this work. We desire at
  this time to express our sincere thanks to those who have extended their patronage
  and courtesies to us for so many years in the support of a work so useful and necessary,
  and trust that the present issue will meet with the same approval that bas been
  accorded its predecessors.  THE PUBLISHERS. '

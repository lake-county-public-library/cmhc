  cured, and surveys made. The advent of this local line will add largely to the rapid
  advancement of Malta, which is fast growing under the most favor- able of influences.
  At the takes a good hotel is open for the accommodation of visitors, and upon their
  placid surface are several yachts and row-boats. The probabilities are that several
  depots, if not a large Union depot, will be erected here, ere another year shall
  have rolled around. The branches of the Colo- rado Central and the Atchison, Topeka
  & Santa Ie Railroads, as well as the main line of the South Park Railway, all head

  sev- eral railway companies will unquestionably be estab- lished here, by reason
  of the existing natural edvan- tages. Their presence will undoubtedly be the incen-
  tive for the construction of other extensive mechan- ical establishments. Without
  dwelling further upon these pertinent facts, a reference at this point to the early

  he town had its birth in 1875, passing through various vicissitudes until the present
  time, at which epoch in its history prosperity and a promising future is smiling
  benignly upon it. In the year in question the first extensive establishment for
  the treatment of ores was crected and put into operation. It was known as the Malta
  Smelting and Mining Company's Works, and it was under the superintendency of Emil
  Leoscher. These works were not only the first erected in Malta, but the first in
  California Gulch. In 1877 the establishment closed for a period of seven or eight
  months; but at the end of this time it was re-opened by James B. Dickson: & Co.,
  under the direction of Valentine Beustch, Esq., who was appointed superintendent.

  few brief years previous the pioneer miner was only seeking placer gold. |  The
  new excitement soon led to the discovery of © the Wheel of Fortune mine, the Undine
  and the | Smuggler (which are known as the Robinson mines) | and the Grand Union,
  which are without question four of the richest silver mines in the State of Colorado.
  The news that these new strikes had been made at Ten Mile was not long in attracting
  the attention of the entire country. As early as December of last year - the prospectors
  wended their way across the Moun- | tains to McNulty’s gulch, stopping at the Brandon
  Bro.'s cabin, then the only acceptable habitation in the Ten Mile Valley. The snow
  at this season of the year was one of the great drawbacks to the develop- opment
  of the country, but this was no bar to the en- terprising men who sought their fortunes
  in this ‘at- tractive mining district.  One of the first to visit this region at
  the period in question, December, 1878, was Colonel John W. |! Jenkins. He is an
  enterprising gentleman who has jong been known as having been identified with Colo-
  rado and the development of her best interests.  Visiting the Ten Mile district,
  notwithstanding the fact that five feet of snow covered the ground, he rapidly inspected
  the several localities in the valley, going over as far as the head of Eagle river,
  and down as far as West Ten Mile. After viewing them all carefully, and with the
  purpose of selecting a loca- tion for a town-site, he finally settled upon what
  had been previously agreed upon by the miners of the Ten Mile district in the early
  part of the previous fall, known as the Bradshaw's placer claim, owned by Frank
  \ . and Perry Brandon. It is located at the mouth of McNulty gulch on Ten-Mile Creek,
  upon a beautiful level plateau of ground. Rising majestically above                                                                                 "

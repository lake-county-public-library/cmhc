text: 'INTRODUCTORY.  OrFicre oF THE Ciry Directory, JuLy, 1885.  Six years have elapsed
  since the issue of the first volume of the Leadville City Directory, during which
  time we have faith- fully chronicled, from year to year, the growth and prosperity
  of the most enterprising city on the continent.  Since our last issue, Leadville
  has undergone a decided change for the better—she has recovered from a financial
  crisis and the evil consequences of an unprecedented boom. Confidence in the permanency
  of our mining and commercial interests is estab- lished, and many who left in despair
  after the “boom,” are returning better satisfied than ever that there is no place
  like © Leadville; and we are confident there are more people residing here at present,
  with a view to permanency, than in any previous  ear. .  y Persons experienced in
  mining are satisfied that there are as good bodies of mineral, undiscovered, in
  the immediate vicinity of Leadville and Lake County, as ever have been touched by
  the pick and shovel of the miner. In view of these few simple facts, we feel justified
  in predicting for the great ‘‘ Carbonate Camp,” in the near future, a larger bullion
  yield than ever before.  Very few, if any, of those who find the Directory so useful,
  have any conception of the arduous task of collecting and arrang- ing the matter
  intelligibly, and the amount of labor and constant care required to produce such
  a work—one from which the citi-  ''zer or stranger, by referring to its pages, can
  readily find infor- mation of importance connected with the city.  We wish to impress
  an important fact upon the minds of those consulting the Directory for information
  which they do not readily find, that all names are arranged in strict alphabetical
  order according to the manner in which they are spelled, and not as they are pronounced,
  therefore one should know the correct spelling of the name to be able to find it
  easily.  We return our sincere thanks to the merchants and citizens of the “Cloud
  City ” for the patronage and courtesies extended to us on this work, and again''renew
  our promise to make each succeeding issue of the City Directory more worthy of commen-
  dation and patronage.  C. & 3B. '

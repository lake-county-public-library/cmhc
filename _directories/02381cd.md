text: 'INTRODUCTORY.  OFFICE OF THE City Directory, July, 1887.  With the publication
  of the Eighth Annual Volume of the Leadville City Directory, the publishers feel
  justified in congratu- lating her citizens upon the marked improvement manifested
  in all branches of trade, as well as the permanency of her great mining industries
  which were never in a more prosperous and flourishing condition than at present.  The
  Colorado Midland Railroad will soon be in running con- dition, which will open up
  new fields for trade as well as to add greater facilities for travel, and will do
  much to push forward the improvement now so apparent.  Building has assumed a more
  substantial character, and during the past year some of the finest business blocks
  have been erected, and others are now in progress that will add much to the beauty
  of our business thoroughfares ; besides, we find much improvement among the residences,
  both in the erection of new as well as the re-modeling of the old style cabin into
  the neat and homelike cottage, which seems to say to the observer that we are satisfied
  -with our mountain home and have decided to stay ; not only have our citizeng concluded
  to remain, but we find in compiling the present volume that many others have been
  added to our popula- tion, thus increasing the Directory list until it contains
  the names and location of 7,728 individuals, which, to use the very lowest estimate,
  would give us a population of between fifteen and sixteen thousand inhabitants.  Feeling
  confident that the present issue will merit the same generous favor that our patrons
  have extended to us in the past, we are,  Most respectfully, C. & B. '

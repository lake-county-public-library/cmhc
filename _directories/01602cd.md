text: 'INTRODUCTORY.  OFFIcE oÂ¥ THE City DiREcTORY, Jury, 1884.  In the preparation
  of the fifth annual volume of the Lead- ville City Directory, herewith presented,
  the publishers have had the usual difficulties to surmount. Yet we have no misgiv-
  ings as to its character, being conscious of having spared no pains or expense to
  render it trustworthy, and we believe this edition to be as perfect as human heads
  and hands, aided by years of experience can make it. Therefore we are gratified
  at the success that has thus far attended our efforts to furnish an acceptable and
  popular Directory. It has been our earnest endeavor to produce a work as nearly
  perfect as possible, with-  ae out pretending to accomplish the tmpossible task
  of rendering it entirely free from errors.  We hope that this volume will meet the
  approbation of the public generally, and prove to our business men that it is worthy
  of a more liberal patronage, and take this opportunity to express our sincere thanks
  to those who have extended their courtesies and patronage to sustain us in our endeavor
  to make the Leadville City Directory a permanent annual publication.  C. & B.       '

text: 'INTRODUCTORY.  '' We take pleasure and considerable pride in presenting for
  the consideration of the people of Leadville this our Thirty-first Volume of the
  City Directory. | While the City Directory has come to be more and more an  indispensable
  feature of modern business and social life, few .people realize the vast amount
  of research and painstaking ef- fort necessary to produce a â€˜work such as this.
  | We extend our thanks to the people of Leadville for their uniform courtesy to
  our solicitors in quest of information and the merchants for their generous patronage
  to make a work of this kind possible, and trust it is well deserved and will prove
  a good investment.  Respectfully, | BALLENGER & RICHARDS. _ '

text: 'INTRODUCTORY.  OrricrE or THE Ciry PIBECTORY } August, 1900  With the issue
  of the nineteenth annual volume of the Leadville City Directory, we are pleased
  to note that the existing evidences of prosperity so plainly visible at the present
  time are such as to justify us in extending our congratulations to the citizens
  of Leadville and all who are interested in the great mining interests over which
  our city is built and surrounded. During the past year a new era in our mining industry
  has been developed which has stimulated confidence in the permanency and extent
  of this branch of labor to such an extent that it has given employment to a greater
  number of people, and caused activity in building such as has not existed in many
  years. These conditions reach out into all lines of trade and its reviving influence
  is felt by all classes, causing our city to assume the active appearance of its
  early years. .  The City Directory is generally considered a reliable index of the
  growth and prosperity of the city which it represents and the present vol- ume gives
  indisputable evidence of our growth during the past year, as it contains 9,181 names,
  being an increase of 1,139 since our last issue, which, to- gether with the encouraging
  outlook of our mining interests and the activity now going on in building, should
  establish confidence in the substantial and permanent prosperity of the Cloud City.
  :  We would here return our sincere thanks to our citizens for the cordial manner
  in which we have been received for many years, and to our patrons for their generous
  approval and substantial aid in the publication of this work.  Very respectfully,
  BALLENGER & RICHARDS. '

text: 'Where the Gold Is Found.  HOW THE AURIFEROUS ORE ZONE HAS BEEN WIDENED BY INTELLIGENT
  PROSPECTING.  By LOUIS S. NOBLE, M. E., Member of the American Institute of Mining
  Engineers.     T the time when the bottom dropped out of the silver market, last
  June, and when the mines and smelters had nearly all suspended operations and were
  waiting to see what relief congress would give them, a number of eastern papers
  called loudly upon us to give up our selfish fight for silver; to leave that matter
  to the superior knowledge of that section of the country which did not produce either
  silver or gold, and was not, therefore, disqualified to decide it by any special
  knowledge of the cost of production of these metals, and the Colorado miner was
  recommended to stop mining silver and to produce gold instead. He was not to expect
  to find it in the large bodies and masses as he had been wont to find silver and
  lead ores, but he was to go on to the mountain-tops and over the less explored parts
  of the country, and work the many small leads and the lower grade bodies which had
  not been worth considering before.  To a certain extent this advice has been followed,
  with the result of adding a number of gold-producing mines to Leadville’s list.
  Our salvation has not been found, however, on the mountain-tops, but on the old
  lines that we followed as silver miners. We have simply transferred our operations
  to a section of country where the geological conditions are not materially different—that
  is to say, where blue limestone exists within a reasonable distance of the surface,
  and where por- phyrys of various ages are found in and above this limestone.  Up
  to this time, gold ore has been found in shipping quantities in a number of localities,
  in general lying east of the old silver-producing hilis, and extending along a considerable
  section of territory, skirting the foot of the Mosquito range.  That portion of
  the Gold Belt which is at present attracting most attention lies on the east slope
  of Breece hill, and in what is known as Idaho park. It is bounded on the northeast
  and east by the Colorado Prince and Ball mountain faults, and on the west by the
  Weston fault.  There are at present working in this neighborhood the following shafts:
  The Ibex Mining Company’s shafts Nos. 1, 2 and 3; the Garbutt shaft, now sink- ing;
  the Little Vinnie shaft; the Fannie Rawlings; the Eliza, working through the Highland
  Chief shaft, and the Curran shaft. Of this number five have shipped ore in considerable
  quantities.  The chief geological peculiarity of this section of territory is the
  occurrence of the ore bodies in the porphyry. In the mines of Carbonate, Iron, Fryer
  and Rock hills the ore bodies were found either at the contact of blue limestone
  and overlying porphyry or in the blue limestone itself, being in either case replace-
  ments of limestone. Under Idaho park this is not in general the case. While ore
  has been found on the contact and in the limestone to some extent, the bulk of    '

text: 'INTRODUCTORY.  OFFICE OF THE Ciry D1IRxECTORY, JULY, 1883.  With the issue
  of the fourth annual volume of the Leadville City Directory, we are pleased to congratulate
  our citizens on the continued prosperity of our mines, as well as the permanent
  growth of the city, which, during the last year, has added many substantial business
  buildings and fine residences, and done much in the way of improvement, and although
  we have been visited by that terrible plague, the small-pox, which neces- sarily
  prostrated business for a time, we are pleased to note that the city has assumed
  its former channel of activity, and to-day we may truthfully speak of our mountain
  home as the liveliest city of its size in the United States.  We take this opportunity
  to express our sincere thanks to those who have aided us by their patronage and
  otherwise assisted in sustaining a publication so valuable and indispensa- ble as
  the City Directory, and hope that it will meet the favor and approval which the
  publishers should expect fromâ€™ a liberal and enterprising community. C. & B.    '

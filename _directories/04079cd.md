text: '20 THE LEADVILLE GOLD BELT.     or three different districts will failin another.
  For instance: Iron in a certain form will be found accompanying the pay chute, or
  in contact with it in some localities, while in another district, in the same class
  of lime and porphyry, the iron will exist in another form in contact or in connection
  with the pay chute, or be absent altogether, 7. ¢., in large quantities. Iron is
  one of the best guides to the miner and almost always leads him on to valuable deposits
  of ore. What isa sure indication of a pay chute or pocket in one locality may indicate
  barren rock in another, and the miner or prospector who has become thoroughly versed
  in one section must not allow himself to be carried away with the idea that he is
  master of the study, for, if he does, he will find disappointment; that he knows
  but comparatively little when he comes to travel around and gain knowledge by experience
  in other districts. Life is too short for any man to become perfect, even in any
  one branch of mining.  I may have digressed somewhat from the main subject, but
  the thoughts were suggested that many will come and go. Many will meet with sore
  and painful disappointment during the coming season. Many may condemn us and say
  ‘“‘we don’t know what we are talking about.”’ J will venture the prediction, however,
  that many will be handsomely rewarded. This country, so long known and yet so ittle
  known, so rich and yet so poor, offering such inducements for mining ventures, and
  yet languishing for want of organized capital, Known to be almost fabulously rich
  in valuable ores years ago, and has as yet produced com- paratively little of that
  wealth—offering great inducements to capital—capital, with an exceptional instance
  or two, has passed it by.  Messrs. John F. Campion and T. S. Wood have given this
  district years of careful study, thought and investigation, backed up their convictions
  and good judgment with their money and the aid of a few friends, and well-directed
  effort, and are now gathering in their reward. What capita! and energy has done
  in one place can be done in another, in the same district, if properly and intelli-
  gently directed, and may be the fortunate possessors of the largest gold producer
  in the world. I believe the time will come, and be witnessed by some who live here
  to-day, that this same Gold Belt will lead on to the great mother vein, a true fissure,
  that will open up wonderful results—not only one, but two or three— from Ball mountain
  to the Maid of Erin, and as they are discovered, one by one, and worked as they
  go down, down for many hundreds of feet, will give up their great wealth in gold.
  I am not one who believe that the deeper down you go the richer becomes the ore,
  but | do believe that the rich values of the mineral depos- its come from below,
  as the gases arise, so in their day and time did gold and silver come up.  How little
  do we know—and, if it comes to that, pray, how much do any of us know—practically,
  of the origin of metalliferous veins? And after separating each and every constituent
  element from ore, knowing the percentage of each, who can return the rock with its
  minerals to its original condition? Sublimation, infiltration or any other fon is
  simply conjecture. There is one happy condition in connection with this great Gold
  Belt: The ground is all taken up and mostly covered by patent. Ground can be secured
  by lease and bond at very reasonable figures, and perfect title. The gold is in
  the rocks in inexhaustible quantity.  What is wanted and required is persevering
  and enterprising men, who have courage to fight the battle of development to the
  end and to victory ; men backed by capital to find it, to take it out at a profit,
  and bring about an era of pros- perity that will benefit the investors and all alike, '

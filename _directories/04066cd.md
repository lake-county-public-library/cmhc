text: 'THE OPHIR OF COLORADO. 7     By the wonderful advances now being made in the
  wet treatment of such ores with cyanide solutions, and, as is being demonstrated
  in the Mercur mine, in Utah, and other localities, all of these classes of ores
  may be made to pay hand- somely. The largest and most permanent gold mines in the
  world have been large bodies of low-grade ore, and when works can be established
  in Leadville to treat the lower grade ores of the Gold Belt, which run from five
  to ten dollars in gold, prospecting and systematic development will be stimulated,
  thereby giving employment to thousands of miners in the district, and increasing
  the gold out- put in proportion.  At the present time [first quarter, 1894], Leadville
  is producing from the Gold Belt not less than five hundred ounces of gold daily.
  This product is derived almost entirely from four mines, three of which have been
  opened within the past six months. The aggregate tonnage exceeds two hundred and
  fifty tons a day, and the total of gold smelting ores alone is greater than that
  of any other district in Colorado.  A more detailed description of these mines would
  be superfluous, as it has already been given in the columns of this paper. Nor is
  it necessary to speculate on the extension of the great Leadville Gold Belt in a
  northerly and southerly direction. It is enough to say that the Leadville Gold Belt
  covers the richest and most promising gold fields of Colorado, and that the combination
  of conditions for economical and profitable mining which can be found there are
  superior to those of -any other district in the West.  In the advantages of geological
  structure, whereby the ore-bearing formations are nearly horizontal, and are brought
  to the surface again and again by fault- ing; in the development and consequent
  knowledge of the continuity, depth and direction of the ore bodies and their associated
  rock formations; in the facilities for draining, handling and mining the ores; and,
  finally, in a market for selling, shipping and smelting or milling its enormous
  product, THE LEADVILLE GOLD BELT WILL BE THE ‘‘ OPHIR’? OF COLORADO.     ae     In
  an editorial in The Leadville Herald Democrat, on the first of January, 1894, the
  writer thus refers to the renewed activity in what had come to be known as the ‘‘Gold
  Belt:”? ‘*The collapse of the silver market was followed quickly with a somewhat
  remarkable development of the more promising section of the new district, with results
  confirmatory of the hopes ever entertained, but enor- mously heightened by the conceded
  success reached in the older workings on the hill. ~The depth of the snow since
  winter set in has seriously retarded surface work and the inauguration of new enterprises,
  requiring extensive plants and the expenditure of large means, but its disappearance
  will doubtless signalize unusual activity on Breece hill and southward to the limits
  of the known Gold Belt. This activity will take on none of the hurrah phases ordinarily
  following in the wake of rich gold discoveries, such as have recently been made
  in the Little Johnnie, but will be quiet and decorous, and along the lines of scientific
  and well-defined exploration. There will be no mad scramble for locations, no serious
  contentions over conflicts, no armed disputes over prior rights. The lawyers may
  not even hope to gather a harvest from legal contentions. And all fer the reason
  that nearly the entire area is covered by United States patents, thus shutting out
  litigation.”’    '

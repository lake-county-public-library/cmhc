text: 'ITS HISTORY AND GEOLOGY. Il     adjoins on the east the principal mines of
  the Leadville District, and has been worked on a small scale ever since 1879. It
  was not worked so vigorously as that portion of the district consisting of Fryer,
  Carbonate and Iron hills, simply because the outcrops of the main vein were more
  disturbed and altered by atmos- pheric agencies. On the three hills mentioned, the
  ore was found intact at no â€˜very great distance from the outcrop, while on Breece
  hill the vein had been leached of its valuable contents for a considerable distance.
  Many attempts were made to reach pay ore in quantity in this vicinity, but none
  were successful, until the Ibex company spent money enough to accomplish the object.  The
  geological formation of the Gold Belt and its rocks are identical with those of
  the Silver Belt, with this distinction, that in the Gold Belt additional eruptive
  rocks are found, differing in characteristics and age somewhat from those associated
  with the Silver Belt. And in this fact we may find a possible explanation of the
  existence of gold in this particular section of the Leadville District. The blue
  limestone is, in both sections, the principal ore-bearing rock.  The belt, as far
  as developed, extends from Long and Derry hill, on the south, to Little Ellen hill
  on the north, and covers an area of four square miles at least. It is bounded on
  the east and west by areas which so far have produced but very little gold and large
  values of silver. The longitudinal extent of the belt, therefore, seems to be in
  a direction northeasterly and southwesterly, and the belief has been expressed that
  it extends from the gold mines at Granite to the southwest, along the foothills
  of the Mosquito range, to Leadville, thence through Birdseye and French gulches
  to McNulty gulch, and from there to Breckenridge. The only support of such a theory
  would be in the fact that gold is found at all these points, and that they lie in
  an approximately straight line, following the main direction of upheaval of the
  Mosquito range. But the distances between these points are too great, and the development
  at none of them is sufficient, at present, to warrant any such conclusion. It is
  sufficient to say that, so far, the belt has been proved up for a length of three
  miles, from Leng and Derry hill, across Printer Boy and Breece hills, Ball mountain
  and Little Ellen hill, to Big Evans gulch.  The latest developments in this area
  certainly warrant the expenditure of large sums for further prospecting and more
  extensive mining in all directions.  Being a continuation of the Silver Belt, it
  is probable that the ore will be found not only on top of the blue limestone, but
  also within the body of it and below it in the lower rocks down to the granite,
  similar to the occurrence of ore in the large mines to the west.  In addition to
  this, the Gold Belt presents chances of finding ore at various horizons above the
  blue limestone, a condition of things never found in the silver producing area of
  Leadville.  The Gold Belt is distinguished, as spoken of above, by a great variety
  of eruptive rocks of different ages. These rocks occur in the shape of intrusive
  sheets parallel to the stratification of the sedimentary rocks in the vicinity,
  or as vertical dikes cutting through the strata and through each other. The shales
  and sandstones, belonging stratigraphically directly above the blue limestone, are
  intersected by masses of eruptive rock similar to those occurring in the blue lime-
  stone, and ore is found not only in the sedimentary rocks above the blue lime- stone,
  but also within the bodies of eruptive rocks, and there at the contact of two dissimilar
  formations, as well as between layers of rock which cannot be distinguished from
  each other, and lying at all angles, from the horizontal to the vertical.    '

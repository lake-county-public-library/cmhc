text: 'INTRODUCTORY.  OFFICE OF THE City DIRECTORY, SEPTEMBER, 1906.  In presenting
  this, the twenty-fifth, edition of The Leadville City Di- rectory to the public
  the publishers would say the experience gained, cov- ering a period of twenty-five
  years, has been used to excellent advantage in gathering and compiling the data
  for this volume.  It is no easy matter to completely and accurately enumerate all
  the residents of a city like Leadville, for there is a great foreign population,
  who know nothing of the English language, and people live in all sorts of out-of-the-way
  places, so that a perfect system with experienced men are indispensable to accuracy
  and completeness.  The City Directory is a publication in which the entire population
  is represented and interested. It is used by all classes and conditions of people
  in every locality in the city, and by every stranger that comes within the city
  limits every day in the year. The use of city directories is becoming more general,
  and their great importance as business factors is now universally recognized. There
  is nothing more conducive to the development and extension of commerce than an easy
  means of commu- nication such as is afforded by a complete and reliable city directory.  Every
  business and professional man should spend some time exam- ining the City Directory.
  He will find it full of profitable suggestions. Keep the City Directory in a convenient
  place for frequent reference, and invite your customers to use it. You will extend
  your acquaintance and advertise your business, and your establishment will be more
  popular and profitable.  The population of the city and immediate surroundings,
  which are virtually Leadville, we would estimate at between thirteen and fourteen
  thousand. .  We thank the people of the city for the courtesy extended to our canvassers,
  and to the business public for their liberal patronage.  THE PUBLISHERS. '

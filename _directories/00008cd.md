  little exertion and expense, and which have speedily enriched their owners, whose
  only out- lay, in many cases, has been a brief period of well directed jlabor. Prospectors
  continue to delve on every hill-sideâ€™ with success, and for many years to come extensive
  rewards remain in store for those who have willing hands and strong arms to aid
  in the develop- ment of the country. To give an idea of the extent that mining has
  assumed, it may be stated that one local company is operating upon a capital of
  twenty million dollars, and its properties promise to yield largely upon the investment.
  Other and numerous corporations and private individuals are doing propor- tionately
  as well with claims which have been but a short time under development.  The health
  of a country frequently elicits consid- erable inquiry. In this connection it can
  be stated that the city has an altitude of 10,200 feet above sea level, which occasions
  some new comers slight diffi- culty in respiration, but this is soon overcome by
  a brief residence. - No contagious or infectious diseases exist, and the greater
  number of deaths thus far have been from pneumonia; this, however, must not be attributed
  so much to climate and local causes as to the careless manner in which many persons
  have lived. The pioneers had but little shelter other than their blankets, and many
  of them not-being used to the rigors of a_ mining camp, succumbed to the fell destroyer.
  This: has now all changed. Large and well furnished hotels, the accommodations of
  which are second to none in the State, are numerous, while cottages and cabins,
  contiguous to the business portion of the city, can readily be purchased or rented
  by those who come into our midst, A full supply of pure crystal water is distributed
  to the dwellings and                                                                                                       "

description: Tabor Opera House-stage, Leadville- Interior view of Leadville, Colorado's
  Tabor Opera House stage on opening night, November 20, 1879. The first show was
  "The Serious Family," a Jack S. Langrishe production. In the foreground are Andrew'
  ornate cast iron and upholstered opera chairs and a piano with sheet music. Proscenium
  boxes with lambrequins, lace curtains and gas chandeliers are on either side of
  the stage. An ornate frescoed ceiling near the stage includes a painting of cherubs,
  flowers and ribbons. The set includes a painted flat with three arches, several
  pieces of furniture, framed paintings, a taxidermied leopard, and a portrait of
  Horace Tabor on an easel at stage right. Tabor contracted J. Thomas Roberts to build
  the three-story opera house in 1879.

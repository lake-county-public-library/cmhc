description: Court House - Lady Justice. "A magnificent statue of Justice has been
  erected over the dome of the new courthouse. The statue is 12 feet in height, blindfolded
  and holding in one hand the balanced scales with which she weighs out justice to
  all alike with an impartial hand, in the other she holds the sword to enforce her
  decrees. Altogether the gilded goddess presents a handsome appearance." - History
  of Leadville and Lake County, Colorado by Don L. Griswold and Jean Harvey Griswold,
  pg. 754.

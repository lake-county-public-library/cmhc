description: Carol Gott's Paleo-point from Twin Lakes 1970. In 1970 near Twin Lakes,
  Mrs. Carol Gott found this classic Plainview Yuma point. The Craftsmanship is so
  distinctive that the point might serve as a type model. It is an exquisite 4-inch
  blade chipped from red chert by removal of long, parallel flakes which extend from
  edge to center. This should date about 8000 B.C.

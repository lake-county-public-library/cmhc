description: '"This ski joring picture was taken at the very beginning of a run. A
  good smooth beginning is just as important for a winning time as is the remainder
  of the race. The rider must be able to guide his horse as close to the jump as is
  safe and still be ready for the next gate and jump on the opposite side of the course."

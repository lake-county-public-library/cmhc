description: '"The Sweitzer 232 CSU-NCAR sailplane ''The Explorer'' is shown being
  towed aloft by the modified Super Cub for a few hours of cloud study. The Super
  Cub experienced no problems in towing the large sailplane aloft even from the two
  mile elevation of the Lake County Airport - the highest airport in North America."

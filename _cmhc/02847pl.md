description: '"This is a miner''s candleholder. The candle was stuck in the cirular
  area next to the hook. The holder could be carried to the work area and then hung
  on a nail or mine car by the hook or imbeded in the mine timers above the miners
  head through use of the sharp, pointed end. Many of this type were homemade." -

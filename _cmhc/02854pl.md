description: '"This is that remains of the building at the Dolly B. Mine after the
  fire. There are many rumors as to thow the fire started, but none are confirmed.
  It is regretful that such precious Leadville landmarks have been torn down, destroyed,
  or burned by fire. The mine at one time, produced thousands of dollars in precious
  metals." - J. LeRoy Wingenbach (Wingenbach Collection)'

description: '"Shown here is the fire damanged wing of the NCAR-CSU sailplane after
  it was the victim of arsonists. The tire belongs to the towing dolly which has been
  placed against the wing and which was also badly damaged by the fire. In the background
  can be seen the fine ash remains of flight clothing, records, electronic gear, books,
  film, tapes etc. used in the experiments. Several of the barrels contained volitaile
  liquids which did not burn or explode for some reason." - J. LeRoy Wingenbach (Wingenbach
  Collection)'

description: '"Serving the total recreation facilities at Turquoise Lake is this modern
  sewage treatment plant capable of processing 100,000 gallons per day. At the present
  time this plant will be serving the four toilet units at the Molly Brown Campground
  plus the ones at the Tabor and Matchless boat ramps. Phased into the system as construction
  is completed will be the 50 unit Baby Doe campground and the full scale resort area
  that is in the projection stages." - J. LeRoy Wingenbach (Wingenbach Collection)'

description: Leadville-4th of July 1903, Unidentified group during 4th of July 1903.
  Some men are in band uniforms, perhaps military. Other men are in suits, as are
  the boys. Most of the ladies are wearing white but some are wearing dark colors.
  The man seated in the center appears to be a priest/reverend/holy man, and it almost
  looks as though there was a wedding.

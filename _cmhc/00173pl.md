description: Laying water line - Men in suits supervise workmen as they install a
  water pipeline for Leadville (Lake County), Colorado. The pipeline is made of wooden
  staves and reinforced with metal bands (probably steel). One workman balances a
  wooden plank on his shoulder while a boy and a man hold buckets. Down the line other
  workers tighten the metal bands around the pipe. The Sawatch Mountain range is in
  the distance.

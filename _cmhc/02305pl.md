description: '"Winter Carnival ski joring is a test of the skills and courage of both
  the rider and the skier plus a trained horse. As the team comes thundering down
  the ice and snow covered course the rider has to control his horse for the smoothest
  ride possible while the skier must take the jumps, through the gates, spearing the
  rings in the most efficient manner. It''s no sport for the novice." - J. LeRoy Wingenbach

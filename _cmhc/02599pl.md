description: '"Back in its Tenth Mountain Division days Camp Hale was filled with
  the rather precise signs of a military reservation denoting what regiment, company,
  batallion, platoon etc. was quartered where, signs for HQ, PX etc. Things looked
  a bit different last week when the state muzle loaders congregated there and put
  up signs for the tipis and other tents, peddlers row etc." - J. LeRoy Wingenbach

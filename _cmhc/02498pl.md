description: '"Just for a bit of diversion at the state muzzle loaders annual shoot
  at Camp Hale several of the fellows did some firing with their home made mortars.
  Here two of them have filled the bottom of the mortar with black powder and are
  now wadding paper into the short bore before putting in a ''charge'' of newspapers
  and wet mud. A beer can complete the charge and it was truely amazing how far the
  can was shot into the air." - J. LeRoy Wingenbach (Wingenbach Collection)'

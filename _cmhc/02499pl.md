description: '"Loading a flintlock is a very precise piece of business. The black
  powder charge has been measured and poured down the barrel before it is tapped into
  place as we see being done here. Then the cloth patch and the ball have to be rammed
  home and then the cap introduced. Mountain Men of old probably would have liked
  to have had a plastic lunch bucket to hold their equipment such as this shooter
  had." - J. LeRoy Wingenbach (Wingenbach Collection)'

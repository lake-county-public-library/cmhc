description: '"The car crusher ram gradually pushes a junk Chevrolet through the portable
  car crusher that had been set up at the Lake County Dump. As the ram slowly pushed
  the car through the crusher the crushing head flattens it to a height of nine inches
  producing a metal slab that will be recycled in the steel mills of Pueblo." - J.
  LeRoy Wingenbach (Wingenbach Collection)'

description: '"The taut line shows that the skier is behind a hard pull by the horse
  and rider as he makes his landing following a jump over one of the lower jumps in
  the ski joring event. He will have only about a second or two to prepare to spear
  one of the rings with the wand that he has in his hands." - J. LeRoy Wingenbach
  (Wingenbach Collection)'

description: '"It must be an awfully odd sensation to have to crawl to base on your
  stomach through several feet of snow. But it does appear that this snowshoe baseball
  player made it in time. Occasionally in a deal like this the ball gets lost and
  has to be shoveled out." - J. LeRoy Wingenbach (Wingenbach Collection)'

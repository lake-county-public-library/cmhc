description: '"Snowshoe baseball at winter carnival time - Leadville, Colorado 10,183
  feet high in the Rockies. In a game like this no one really cares who wins as the
  Leadville Lions and the Leadville Jaycees have as much fun playing as the spectators
  do watching." - J. LeRoy Wingenbach (Wingenbach Collection)'

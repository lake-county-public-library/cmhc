description: '"The various classifications of snowmobiles makes for a number of different
  types of races in the Leadville Winter Carnival. These varied machine types and
  sizes race in their own group in the speed races, ten times around a 1/4 mile oval,
  obstacle races and a cross country race. These events bring snowmobile enthusiasts
  from all over Colorado and the neighboring states who belong to the racing circuit
  with their modified machines. The Leadville races in 1972 were part of a Class B
  Rocky Mountain Snowmobile Association sanctioned race. There are also separate divisions
  for the amateur racers, for the youngsters and Powderpuff sections for the women."

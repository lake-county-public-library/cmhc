description: '"Six toilet units were built by the Forest Service at the Turquoise
  Lake Molly Brown Campground at a cost of $15,000 each. They provide hot and cold
  running water, electrical hand dryers, electric appliance outlets and many other
  special features. There have been very attractively designed of pre-cast sections
  and should withstand all attempts at vandalism. Their design blends in well with
  the rustic mountain surroundings." - J. LeRoy Wingenbach (Wingenbach Collection)'

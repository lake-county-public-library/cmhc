description: '"Photographing a snowmobile speed race can provide plenty of exercise
  for the photographer also. Such was the case in the 1972 Leadville Winter Carnival
  snowmobile races as the photog had to jump out of the way just as the snowmobile
  hit the fence. No picture." - J. Leroy Wingenbach (Wingenbach Collection)'

description: 'Margaret "Madge" (Alderson) Shelton, Included was a portion of a newspaper
  clipping: "Miss Madge Alderson, as Mrs. Sarah Teaberry, had certainly ruined every
  prospect of future matrimony only for her timely vindication as a very amiable and
  sweet tempered wife at the close of the second act. Up to that time she had tyrannized
  over her unfortunate husband in such a realistic manner that the sympathies of the
  audience were with him, but the reconciliation, when it did come, was comoplete
  and was a sourse of gratification to those who had been pitying poor Teaberry. Her
  acting was as good as could have been done."'

description: 'Mrs. Thomas Shelton (Madge Alderson Shelton) from a steel engraving
  19.75" x 24". Included was a portion of a newspaper clipping: "Miss Madge Alderson,
  as Mrs. Sarah Teaberry, had certainly ruined every prospect of future matrimony
  only for her timely vindication as a very amiable and sweet tempered wife at the
  close of the second act. Up to that time she had tyrannized over her unfortunate
  husband in such a realistic manner that the sympathies of the audience were with
  him, but the reconciliation, when it did come, was comoplete and was a sourse of
  gratification to those who had been pitying poor Teaberry. Her acting was as good
  as could have been done."'

description: '"These are the original badges of membership for the five orders of
  the Odd Fellows as they existed at the time of the lodges founding in Oro City in
  1872. From left to right they are in the following order with the difference being
  in the color of the rosette at the top - white for those just initiated, pink for
  the Covenant, royal blue for the Royal Degree, green for Rememberance and Scarlet
  for the last degree. Green has now been eliminated and combined with the royal blue.
  This happened around the end of 1880. The rosette at the top, in the proper color
  was made of wool yarn, the ribbon itself was made of black silk, and the lettering
  and the tassle of gold. It has a burlap backing on the rosette to which is attached
  a metal fastener with straight pin to attach to the lothing. The five degree badges
  are in remarkably good condition despite their 100 years of age." - J. LeRoy Wingenbach

description: 'E. M. X. Club - December 11, 1909 December 11, 1909: The newest social
  organization of the city was the E.M.X. club, largely composed of young high school
  men, and there were some 30 charter members. They leased Foresters Hall on East
  Seventh Street, the entire building, dance floor, club rooms, dining hall kitchen.
  About 40 couples got the new organization off to a fine start with a social dance,
  and the girls who were guests plastered the new quarters with pennants, pictures
  and pillows.'

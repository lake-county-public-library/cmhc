From left to right they are in the following order with the difference being in the color of the rosette at the top - white for those just initiated, pink for the Covenant, royal blue for the Royal Degree, green for Rememberance and Scarlet for the last degree. Green has now been eliminated and combined with the royal blue. This happened around the end of 1880. The rosette at the top, in the proper color was made of wool yarn, the ribbon itself was made of black silk, and the lettering and the tassle of gold. It has a burlap backing on the rosette to which is attached a metal fastener with straight pin to attach to the lothing. The five degree badges are in remarkably good condition despite their 100 years of age.\" - J. LeRoy Wingenbach (Wingenbach Collection)",

Buildings that can be seen include the old Lake County Court House with Lady Justice and her scales and the American National Bank with its corner tower dome. The cafe on the west side located between West 6th and West 7th Street is probably the Saddle Rock Cafe which opened in 1916 at 607 Harrison Avenue. The owner was Alfred Gross. The cafe closed or was moved from there in 1938. Business signs include Cafe, Rooms, Drugs, and Tailor.",

Buildings that can be seen include the old Lake County Court House with Lady Justice and her scales and the American National Bank with its corner tower dome. The cafe on the west side located between West 6th and West 7th Street is probably the Saddle Rock Cafe which opened in 1916 at 607 Harrison Avenue. The owner was Alfred Gross. The cafe closed or was moved from there in 1938. Business signs include Cafe, Rooms, Drugs, and Tailor.",

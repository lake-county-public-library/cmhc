text: '   ,  NOTE  “~  In 1870, Colorado was a Territory and Lake County covered a
  vast area which extended from the backbone of the Rocky Mountains to the Utah border.  The
  1870 census for Lake County is divided into four sections for four population centers;
  namely, Centerville, Fairplay, Granite, and Oro City. Due to later restructuring
  of Colorado counties, Centerville and Granite are now in Chaffee County and Fairplay
  is in Park County. The site of Oro City remains in Lake County.  The mystery is:
  "What became of the population between the Rockies and Utah?” '

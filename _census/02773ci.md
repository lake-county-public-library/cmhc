text: 'IMPORTANT FORWARD  The following pages are an alphabetical index to be used
  in  conjunction with the 1930 census for Lake County, Colorado. To derive the greatest
  benefit from this index, it is well that you, the researcher, understand the difficulties
  encountered in compiling this aid. This knowledge will help you to deal with the
  complexities of the census.  A.  Aptitude for spelling and writing does not appear
  to have been prerequisites for early 20"-century census enumerators. In an era when
  illiteracy was still an accepted way of life, this is not surprising. What is surprising
  is the occasionally creative, albeit erroneous, spelling of names.  Writing can
  appear tangled, Victorian flourishes; cramped, near- sighted scratches; or lovely,
  fluid penmanship, which has faded to near nothingness. Every style presents its
  own problems for deciphering the hidden message. Our version, copied as we saw it,
  may not coincide with your version, as you see it.  Questionable spelling of last
  names is considered to be one of the most prominent hazards within this work. All
  names have been recorded as interpreted by the Indexer in regards to careless writing,
  and as spelled by the enumerator except in those cases when other sources provide
  a more logical spelling. In these rare instances, the accepted spelling appears
  in alphabetical order and the name as it appears in the census follows in parenthesis.
  It is vitally important, therefore, that you search for every possible spelling
  variation, “sounds-like,” foreign and Americanized versions, and even reverse placement
  of names, i.e. James, Joseph instead of Joseph, James. You may even wish to run
  through all names within an alphabetical category for the name you desire.  Incompleteness
  in a census is not uncommon. A census can be incomplete in spite of a conscientious
  census-taker. However, there have been census-takers who took the job only for what
  they could get out of it or because it was assigned to them by legislative act.
  Many of these persons were not well qualified and did not satisfactorily fulfill
  their obligations. Many of the census '

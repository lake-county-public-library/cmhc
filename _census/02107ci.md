text: 'iC. Often incorrect data, which resulted in inconsistencies in the subsequent
  censuses, was given to the assistants and enumerators by members of the family.
  Inconsistent ages illustrate the problem best but places of birth and names also
  have some small tendency to change from one census to the next.  The author of this
  index encountered all of the above-mentioned  problems and more. It is hoped, however,
  that this aid will, in some small way, help to alleviate your frustration in working
  with the census.  Historical Research Cooperative  Extracted in part from: Researcher''s

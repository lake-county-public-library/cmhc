text: "   IMPORTANT NOTE  In 1860, the state of Colorado did not exist. It's area
  was encompassed by Kansas Territory. And, in 1860, Lake County did not exist, either.
  Arapahoe County, Kansas Territory, covered a vast portion of what is now Colorado,
  including the present Lake County.  For the purpose of this index, only that portion
  of Arapahoe County which relates to Lake County has been extracted, namely the California
  Gulch segment. The rush of gold-seekers into California Gulch began in April of
  1860. The hundreds of names appearing here, which were enumerated during the summer
  of 1860, attest to the lure of the precious metal. "

text: 'they listed many families twice in different parts of their schedules, sometimes
  varying the information slightly.  C. Often incorrect data, which resulted in inconsistencies
  in the subsequent censuses, was given to the assistants and enumerators by members
  of the family. Inconsistent ages illustrate the problem best but places of birth
  and names also have some small tendency to change from one census to the next.  D.
  Too often the census schedules are. difficult to read, and there are many reasons
  for this. In addition to careless writing, unfamiliar abbreviations and the workings
  of time on poor quality inks are all familiar problems. There are additional problems
  in reading microfilmed’ copies of the censuses. On some the photography was poor
  -- under-exposure, over-exposure, etc. Others present special photography problems,
  such.  as the writing was faded and simply did not photograph well.  The author
  of these indices encountered all of the above-mentioned problems and more. Familiarity
  with certain names, knowing that the Henry A. W. Tabor in the 1870 census was really
  Horace A. W. Tabor, added greatly to the frustration of this project. It is hoped,
  however, that these indices will, in some small way,‘ help to alleviate your frustration
  in working with ane censuses.  Nancy Manly, Indexer Sherrill Warford, Typist Historical

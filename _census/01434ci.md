text: 'IMPORTANT FOREWORD  The following pages are an alphabetical fndex to be used
  tn conjunction with the 1900 census for Lake County, Colorade, To derive the greatest
  benefit from this Index, It Is well that you, the researcher, understand the difficulties
  encountesed fn comp! ling this ald. This knowledge will help you to deal with complexities
  of the census.  A. Aptitude for spelling and writing does not now appear to have
  been prerequisites for early 20th=-century census enumerators. In an era when [illiteracy
  was stil! an accepted way of IIfe, this Is not surprising. What Is surprising ts
  the occasionally creative, albelt erroneous, spelling of names,  Questionable spelling
  of last names Is considered to be one of the most prominent hazards within this
  work, All names have been recorded as interpreted by the Indexer In regards to careless
  writing, and as spelled by the enumerator except in those cases when other sources
  provide a more logical spelling. In these rare Instances, the accepted spelling
  appears In alphabetical order and the name as it appears in the census follows In
  parenthesis, It Is vitally Important, therefore, that you search for every possible
  spelling variation, â€œsounds=-like," forelgn and Americanized version, and even reverse
  placement of names, !.e,. James, Joseph Instead of Joseph, James, You may even wish
  to run through all names within an alphebetical category for the name you desire.  Writing
  can appear In tangled, Victorian flour!lshes; cramped, nearesighted scratches; or
  lovely, fiuld penmanship which has faded to near nothingness. Every style presents
  Its own problems for deciphering the hidden message, Our version, copled as we saw
  It, may not coincide with your version, as you see It,  B. Incompleteness In a census
  Is not uncommon, A census can be Incomplete In spite of a conscientious census-taker,
  However, there have been census-takers who took the Job only for what they could  get
  out of It or because It was assigned to them by legislative act. Many of these persons
  were not wel! quatified and did not satisfactorl ly fulfill thelr obligations, Many
  of the eensus schedules reflect  this because the Instructions which the census-takers
  rece! ved  (or should have recelved) were not fol lowed,  Some schedules IIst persons
  In a family by Initials only, A few schedules |ist no places of birth or age. Sometimes
  familtes were not home when the enumerator made his vistt and nelghbors were asked
  to give the Information, or if the assistant was personally acquainted with the
  family he would complete the schedules to the best of his own  a ei '

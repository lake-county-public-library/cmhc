text: 'IMPORTANT  FOREWORD  The following pages are an alphabetical -index to be used
  in conjunction with the 1885 census for Lake County, Colorado. To derive the greatest
  benefit from this index, it its well that you, the researcher, understand the difficulties
  encountered in compiling this aid. This knowledge will ‘help you to deal . with
  the complexities of the census,  A. Aptitude for spelling and writing does not now
  appear to have been prerequisites for 19th=-century census enumerators. In an era
  when illiteracy was an accepted way of life, this is not surprising. What is surprising
  is the. occasionally creative, albeit erroneous, spelling. of names.  Writing can
  appear in tangled, Victorian flourishes; cramped, near-sighted scratches; or lovely,
  fluid penmanship which has faded to near nothingness. Every style presents its own
  problems for deciphering the hidden message. Our version, copied as we saw it, may
  not coincide with your eae as you see it.  Questionable spelling of last names is
  considered to be one of the most prominent hazards within this work. All mames have
  been recorded as interpreted by the Indexer in regards to careless writing, and
  as spelled by the enumerator except in those cases when other sources provide a
  more logical spelling. In these rare instances, the accepted spelling appears in
  alphabetical order and the name as it appears in the census follows in parenthesis.
  It is vitally important, therefore, that you search for every possible spelling
  variation, "sounds like,"'' and even reverse placement of names, i.e. James, Joseph
  instead of Joseph, James. You may even wish to run through all names within an alphabetical
  category for the name you desire,  B. Incompleteness in a census is not uncommon,
  A census can be incomplete in spite of a conscientious census-taker. However, there
  have been census—takers who took the job only for what they could get out of it
  or hecause it was assigned to them by legislative act. Many of these persons were
  not well qualified and did not satisfactorily fulfill their obligations. Many of
  the census schedules reflect this because the instructions which the census-takers
  received (or should have received) were not followed.  Some schedules list persons
  in a famiiy by initials only. A few schedules list no places of birth or age. Sometimes
  families were not home when the census=taker made his visit and neighbors were asked
  to give the information, or if the assistant was personally acquainted with the
  family he would complete the schedules to the best of his own knowledge. There were

text: 'IMPORTANT FOREWORD  .The following pages are an alphabetical index to be used
  in _conjunction with the 1910 census for Lake County, Colorado. To derive the greatest
  benefit from this index, it is well that you,  the researcher, understand the difficulties
  encountered in compiling this aid. This knowledge will help you to deal with the
  complexities of the census.  A. Aptitude for spelling and writing does not now appear
  to have been prerequisites for early 20th-century census enumerators. In an era  when
  illiteracy was still an accepted way of life, this is not surprising. What is surprising
  is the occasionally creative, albeit erroneous, spelling of names.  Writing can
  appear in tangled, Victorian flourishes; cramped, near= sighted scratches; or lovely,
  fluid penmanship which has faded to near nothingness. Every style presents its own
  problems for deciphering the hidden message. Our version, copied as we saw it, may
  not coincide with your version, as you see it.  Questionable spelling of last names
  is considered to be one of the most prominent hazards within this work. All names
  have been recorded as interpreted by the Indexer in regards to careless writing,
  and as spelled by the enumerator except in those cases when other sources provide
  a more logical spelling. In these rare instances, the accepted spelling appears
  in alphabetical order and the name as it appears in the census follows in parenthesis.
  It is vitally important, therefore, that you search for every possible spelling
  variation, "sounds-like," foreign and Americanized versions, and even reverse placement
  of names, i.e. James, Joseph instead of Joseph, James. You may even wish to run
  through all names within an alphabetical category for the name you desire.  B. Incompleteness
  in a census is not uncommon. A census can be incomplete in spite of a conscientious
  census-taker. However, there have been census- takers who took the job only for
  what they could get out of it or because it was assigned to them by legislative
  act. Many of these persons were not well qualified and did not satisfactorily fulfill
  their obligations. Many of the census schedules reflect this because the instructions
  which the enumerators received (or should have received) were not followed.  Some
  schedules list persons in a family by initials only. A few schedules list no places
  of birth or age. Sometimes families were not home when the census-taker made his
  visit and neighbors were asked to give the information, or if the assistant was
  personally acquainted with the family he would complete the schedules to the best
  of his own knowledge. There were also times when young children in the family provided
  the "facts" for the census enumeration if no one else was at home. '

text: 'schedules reflect this because instructions that the enumerators received (or
  should have received) were not followed.  Some schedules list persons in a family
  by initials only. A few schedules list no places of birth or age. Sometimes families
  were not home when the census-taker made his visit and neighbors were asked to give
  the information, or if the assistant were personally acquainted with the family
  he would complete the schedules to the best of his own knowledge. There were also
  times when young children in the family provided the “facts” for the census enumeration
  if no one else was at home.  C. | Members of the family gave often-incorrect data,
  which resulted in inconsistencies in the subsequent censuses, to the assistants
  and enumerators. Inconsistent ages illustrate the problem best but places of birth
  and names also have some small tendency to change from one census to the next.  The
  author of this index encountered all of the above-mentioned problems and more. It
  is hoped, however, that this aid will, in some small way, help to alleviate your
  frustration in working with the census.  Extracted in part from: Researcher’s Guide

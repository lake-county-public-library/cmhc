text: '   IMPORTANT FOREWORD  The following pages are alphabetical indices to be used
  in conjunction with the 1860, 1870, and 1880 censuses for the area which is now
  known as Lake County, Colorado. To derive the greatest benefit from these indices,
  it is well that you, the researcher, understand the difficulties encountered in
  compiling this aid. This ‘knowledge will help you to deal with the complexities
  of the censuses.  A. Aptitude for spelling and writing does not now appear to have
  been prerequisites for 19th-century census enumerators. In an era when illiteracy
  was an accepted way of life, this is not surprising. What is surprising is the occasionally
  creative, albeit erroneous, spelling of names. Five variations of O''Brien and four
  variations of Sullivan appear in the 1880 census alone. .  Writing can appear in
  tangled, Victorian flourishes; cramped, near-sighted scratches; or lovely, fluid
  penmanship which has faded to near nothingness. Every style presents its own problems
  for deciphering the hidden message. Our version, copied as we saw it, May not coincide
  with your version, as you see it.  Questionable spelling of last names is considered
  to be one of the most prominent hazards within this work. All names have been recorded
  as interpreted by the Indexer in regards to careless writing, and as spelled by
  the enumerator. It is vitally important, therefore, that you search for every possible
  spelling variation, "sounds-like," and even reverse placement of names, i.e. James,
  Joseph instead of Joseph, James. You may even wish to run through all names within
  an alphabetical category for the name you desire.  B. Incompleteness in a census
  is not uncommon. A census can be incomplete in spite of a conscientious census-taker.
  However, there have been census-takers who took the job only for what they could  get
  out of it or because it was assigned to them by legislative act. Many of these persons
  were not well qualified and did not satisfactorily fulfill their obligations. Many
  of the census schedules reflect this because the instructions which the census-takers
  received (or should have received) were not followed.  Some schedules list persons
  in a family by initials only. A few schedules list no places of birth or age. ''
  Sometimes’ families were not home when the census~taker made his visit and neighbors
  were asked to give the information, or if the assistant was personally acquainted
  with the family he would complete the schedules to the best of his own knowledge.
  There were also times when young children in the family provided the "facts" for
  the census enumeration if no one else was at home.  Some persons moved frequently
  and appear more than once within the same census, and some census-takers padded
  the population. Apparently reimbursed in proportion to the number of families enumerated, '
